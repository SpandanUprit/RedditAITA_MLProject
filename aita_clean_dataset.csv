"AITA for telling my wife the lock on my daughter's door does not get removed til my brother inlaw and his daughters are out of our house? My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia &amp; Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.
His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.

Olivia &amp; Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed. 

Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.
I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!

Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.
Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said ""my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff"" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this ""defect"" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.
He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.

I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from ""spending time"" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.

She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.

Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.",Not the A-hole,ocx94s
"AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard? I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all

UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now

HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

"AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me? I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

"AITA for bringing up my brother's ""premature"" birth at Christmas dinner to get my parents to shut up? I am a nurse practitioner and I am the primary care provider for a lot of the low risk maternity cases at the practice where I work.  I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. 

My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  

I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  

So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  

My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  

So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.

"AITA for making a dad joke? Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry.

"AITA for not taking down my video that was a gift from my best man. I have a sister that’s 6 years older than me. 

My parents for years cancel on me last min because of my sister. I have a basketball game. Ops sorry sister doesn’t feel like going out. I am graduating ops sorry sister had a bad day at work. They have missed both major and smaller events in my life because of her melt downs.

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen.

The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset.

I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fiancé and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea.

I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service.

The post caption was “My best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick.

I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.
Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn’t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house. 

I maybe the A here. I didn’t take it down when I got my messages. I didn’t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone.

My dad told me to take down the video. It was “just a bad night for them”. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to “make up” my wedding? It’s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter.

Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn’t have.

"AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin? We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",Everyone Sucks,cihc3z
"AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist? About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. 

I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. 

That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",Not the A-hole,iagtso
"AITA for ""announcing"" that my dad's not paying my college tuition My aunt and uncle are paying for my cousins college.  

My dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff. Which would be fine if you have a normal dad. Mine isn't.  

My dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked ""missing"" because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides ""to make sure I'm not hiding anything "". 

I decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay. Which I could totally see him doing.  I'd rather be in debt than controlled for 4 more years.  

I just finished my first year. 

Well my family got together on the 4th and... well sometimes they're nosey.   They were talking about my cousins school and my uncle looked at my dad and said ""well how much is - my name- school costing you?"" 

I said ""what are you asking him for I'm the one paying for it?"" 

Later on my dad was pissed off and said that it was out of line to say that and I embarrassed him.

"WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle? Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. 

That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",Not the A-hole,dkqv29

I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew?

"AITA for dropping our dinner on the ground and walking out when my boyfriend asked me ""What's for dinner tonight, b*tch?"" I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes ""what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH"" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. 

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!"" 

He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us

AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me ""what's for dinner tonight, b*tch""

Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:

&gt; ""But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?""

Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. 

This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like ""Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)""

And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES.

"AITA for refusing to pay for my sister's husband's surgery with my inheritance/college money? 


Context: My sister (F27) and I (18F) lost our dad a year ago. He was my only parent, mom was never in mine or my sister's life. Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her house
I live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet).


My sister &amp; I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.
only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.
I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in &amp; out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future.


I refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.
My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now. 

She's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father.

"AITA for walking out of the Airport when I saw my husband's mom standing there with her luggage? 

I F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.



So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say ""FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her"".

Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there ""anyway"" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.

I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.

"AITA for getting up from my chair in the middle of christmas dinner and shouting ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY"" in response to my husband's observation? So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his ""observations"" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say ""oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though..."" or when he looks at my waist and says ""Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!"". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.



We went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said ""I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!"". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!"". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an ""observation"" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.



Now I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??",Not the A-hole,zz5str
"AITA for storming off from my sister's wedding after she deadnamed my son? I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.

My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it. 

Her wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said ""where's Nia's dress?"". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said ""fine"" and that was it.

At the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card ""Nia"". I went to my sister and she said she used ""their real name"". I told her me and the boys are leaving and she told me ""don't you dare cause a scene at MY WEDDING, Nia can be a guy any other day"".

"AITA for silently getting up and walking out of the restaurant during NYE dinner after I was told to pay for everyone at the table (my inlaws)? 
I f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.


I noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.


For NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my "" inheritance pocket"" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.


He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.


He is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.

"AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him? So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.

"AITA for calling my SIL a racist after she compared my cooking to ""making kung pao chicken""? **TL;DR at bottom**

For context: I've been married to my wife for ~10 years and we're a mixed-race couple (I'm Asian and she's Caucasian). I've gotten along with her family (MIL, BIL, SIL), but I always felt like her FIL and other SIL (Sarah) never liked me.

I'm a professionally trained chef with 15+ years of experience and I work at a high-end Chinese restaurant (a spin-off of a popular one in Beijing) in a large US city. My crew and I have won several awards, and I've been explicitly told I'll be the next executive chef. Sarah is also a professionally trained chef and works at a popular upscale French restaurant in the city. She constantly brags about it and (no joke) compares herself out loud to Ramsay and Bourdain.

Whenever I'm at my MIL and FIL's house and helping out in the kitchen, Sarah is *always* criticizing everything I do. Whether it's chopping, braising, marinating, etc., she always butts in with comments like ""Umm, I think you should actually do X like this..."". I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like ""Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it.""

Things came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like ""Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things"". It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said ""making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count"". The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled ""SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU"". I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her ""a racist piece of shit"", apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife.

Apparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying ""it was a joke but kind of true"" and that I was ""being too sensitive"". The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism.

AITA?

**TL;DR:** I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it ""making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant"". Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do?

**EDIT:** My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me)

**EDIT2/UPDATE:** So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going ""This is you right?..."". Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like ""If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed"". I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear

**EDIT3/UPDATE2:** Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that ""[my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point"" and threatened a ""world of hurt"" if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks

**EDIT4/UPDATE3:**  *Lots of stuff just went down*

1. My wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of ""[her] {Asian slur} husband"". Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...
2. Wife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.
3. Facebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in.

Suffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear

[Me right now](https://i.imgur.com/8QnGdHK.gifv)

I think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks

**EDIT5/UPDATE4:**

Turns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:
&gt; No, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this.

*I'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)*

Suffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it ""Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much""). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs.

We didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (*still disappointed in you Doug*). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything.


**FIL (aka Doug)**

Apparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the ""Kung Pao Incident"" and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town).


**Extended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)**

You may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though.


**Sarah / SIL**

According to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She’s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her).


It sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading.

"AITA - Telling my parents to pay me back my college tuition if they want a relationship I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. 

Because of their expectation I’d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I’m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn’t allowed to apply for college.

I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn’t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought “them” for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.

My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I’m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were “sorry if they caused me pain” but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn’t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn’t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn’t being serious and I just left. Since then, I’ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I’m being immature and hurtful.

"AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson? New to reddit, please bare with. 

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way.

"AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister? The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&amp;#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

Edit/Update kinda:

Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this &lt;3

"AITA for switching to regular milk to prove my lactose intolerant roommate keeps stealing from me? Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don’t split costs on is groceries. Everyone’s in charge of buying their own food and we don’t touch whatever doesn’t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. 

This issue has been going on almost a year and I’m sick of it. 

One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I’ve only drank once or twice. 

I confronted R about this lots of times and that’s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I’m crazy even though it’s so obvious. 

My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it’s not him. It’s always after we get back home and R’s already left for work that I notice my food’s gone. My roommate’s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I’m guessing cause R doesn’t like what he buys.

The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what’s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.

Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he’s lactose intolerant. 

The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with “So then you’re the one who’s been stealing?” 

He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was “sometimes” drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn’t have done that if he’d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.

My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It’s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we’re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  

I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I’m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",Not the A-hole,hvcvtt
"AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs? I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. 

She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl.

"AITA for saying I'll be driving myself and paying for my own room on the upcoming family vacation so I won't have to be a babysitter? I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.

This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the ""Buts"" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.

My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.

Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.

Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.

Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.

Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying ""Nope!"" to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.

"AITA for kicking out one of my bridesmaids for showing up in the wrong dress? My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move.

In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH""s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. 

I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.

She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more ""girly"". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH""s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. 

I paid for all the dresses. 

Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.

So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. 

I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. 

The wedding went on and it was truly amazing.

Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",Not the A-hole,10av2g7
"AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf? I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

"AITA for how I fought my boyfriend's medical bill, going ""too far""? My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. 

I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. 

So I...

- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. 

- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices

- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute

- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere 

- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management 

- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors

- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my ""client"" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. 

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

"AITA for laughing when my son came home from meeting his girlfriend's parents because he chose to behave like he does at home? My son burps a lot while eating. I have tried telling him multiple times that it is rude. I've told him to slow down so he doesn't swallow air with his food.  I've told him that it is disgusting. 

My wife will instantly jump in to defend him. She will say that's just the way he is and that it's not his fault. 

The thing is he can control himself when I remind him. He just chooses not to.  

He just went on a date with his girlfriend last night and she tore him a new asshole. It was his first time meeting her parents since they live in another city. 

They went out to a fancy restaurant and he burped all the way through supper. He came home almost in tears from her chewing him out for behaving like a jackass in front of her family. 

I heard him telling my wife about it and I laughed. She asked what was so funny and I reminded them both that I had tried dozens if not hundreds of times to teach him table manners and he rejected them and she protected him. I said that now he is a grown man and he had to learn the hard way.

"AITA for not letting my best friend have her wedding on my property after being uninvited? One of my (29M)  best friends “Carla” (31f) is getting married soon. It’s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they’ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it’s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fiancé “Rick” were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on &amp; off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are.

Now my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn’t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it’s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don’t have actual confirmation if that’s exactly what he was told. All Carla’s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he’s angry at her for never saying anything. 

It became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they’re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn’t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place. 

Rick said so to and in my mind I’m going “he doesn’t want the guy who dated his fiancée  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.” My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They’re going to have to find some place else since we’re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn’t make sense. Rick doesn’t want me around because he’s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I’ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I’m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don’t think that I am, it just doesn’t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we’re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it’s the least I can do after everything. AITA?",Not the A-hole,ob0wdk
"AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic? I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

"AITA for jumping out of a bathroom window to avoid my mom’s attempt at forcing a reunion between me and my ex fiancé? Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fiancé Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. 


The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. 


I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. 


So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. 


I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. 


My mom called a short while ago saying she’s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she’s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn’t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",Not the A-hole,efcc8u
"AITA for refusing to tell my husband the gender of our baby after he skipped going to the dr appointment with me? My husband &amp; I are expecting. This is our first baby and we're excited.

His response is always ""I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?"".


Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.



He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me.

"AITA for using flash cards to explain to my brother and his wife why they can't bring their rainbow baby to my wedding? 
My fiancee (F) and I (M) are getting married. We've decided wedding's gonna be childfree. No hate towards children just to keep it more organized and contained.


My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls ""miracle"" or ""rainbow"" baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years. 

When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring ""blessings"" for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop.


My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase ""the wedding is childfree, period"" and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order: 

- The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom). 

- Is Child (with a sticker of a baby). 

- FREEE (with a sticker of a 🚫 sign). 

- PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker). 

They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure.

"AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding? Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.

I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother.

"AITA for yelling at my girlfriend to “stop fucking eating?” My (M26) sister (F23) runs a bakery business and she’s been struggling lately to keep up with orders because she’s been short staffed. She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do.

Unfortunately, the past four times I’ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she “just wanted to try some.” I’ve tried explaining to her that she can’t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.

Today, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. 

I get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to “stop fucking eating” the food I’m making, because it’s not for her and she’s contaminating it.

"AITA if I stop paying my daughter’s tuition over a disgusting comment she made towards my new girlfriend? My (56M) wife died at the young age of 51 from a car accident. I was in deep mourning for about a year after her death. I met my new GF C (43F) around January. C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She’s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.

I have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.

E and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she’s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time. When C went to grab her third helping of mashed potatoes, A said “Don’t you think you’ve eaten enough, you fat pig?” C started sobbing immediately and ran off into the bedroom. I felt my face turn red and told A to get out. 

About half an hour after A left I texted her stating that I would no longer pay her tuition unless 1. She apologized to C and 2. C accepts her apology. A must have assumed that I was bluffing because she instead doubled down on her behavior during Thanksgiving dinner.

I (30f) met my bf (30m) 3 years ago. Before me he was together with his HS sweetheart. They fell out of love and broke up. A year later we started dating. His mom however was still heartbroken about it. I was very understanding and thought she needed time to get to know me. The ex basically grew up with them and they saw her as a part of the family. 

For the first year of my relationship his mom would call me ex’s name, until bf got angry once and told her to be nice. She laughed it off and said it was just a habit. After that she started calling me the wrong name. (Janet instead of Jenny; fictional names just for the story). I corrected her a couple of times but she seemed to like hurting me so I ignored it later.

My bf has two sisters and a couple of weeks before thanksgiving we were invited to bbq at the older sister’s house. I was in the kitchen with my bf’s mom, the sisters and one of their husbands. The older sister then talked about how my BF praised my cooking to her husband and the mom was listening. She then said iut loud “SURE! Why don’t we let Janet make the turkey this year?”.

On thanksgiving we went to his mom’s house with the usual wine and dessert. She was shocked l, everybody was shocked. I said “what? I thought Janet is bringing the turkey!”.

"AITA for suing my parents for my college money. My great-aunt set up savings accounts for all of her female relatives. In our culture education for women is not really valued and she thought that was bullshit. 

She lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could. 

When she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could. 

My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. 

When I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. 

I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks. 

I am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest. 

My brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.

"AITA for calling my mom when my husband refused to listen to me? I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.

The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week. 

When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. 
I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it ""wasn't that bad"". My reply was ""fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up."" Completly exhausted
I fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.

The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  

When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.

That lead to a fight where I told him. ""I am too sick to have company and they need to leave"".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.

My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. ""Since your family can stay so can we."" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.

I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.

Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.
My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.

My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.

SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. 
Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight. 

My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.
Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.

Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.
Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.
Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. 
He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. 
He begged me for another chance. 
The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita.
 We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.

Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",Not the A-hole,11374y5
"AITA for getting my daughter a hotel room entirely for herself after her stepsisters made her sleep on the floor? My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) &amp; (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).


While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said ""It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way.."". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm ""playing favorites"" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.

We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.


ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.

Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.



ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.

And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",Not the A-hole,1087lbn
"AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid? So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.

I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.

Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.

Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""

I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.

My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.

So AITA here?

Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",Not the A-hole,hsdpho
"AITA for cancelling mother's day celebration that I arranged for my wife after hearing what she told my son? 

I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.

As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept ""attitude"" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.

I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",Not the A-hole,ulcrp6
"AITA for cancelling the entire vacation when I found out that my stepdaughters deliberately hid my daughter's passport to get her to stay home? I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 &amp; 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.

there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.


I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica &amp; Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too ""fond"" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.

We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.

"AITA for giving my MIL a fake copy of my house key and ""exposing"" her on Christmas dinner? 
I wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say.


My husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her.


Days gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily ""called me out"" on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her ""didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!"" She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family.

AITA?

Eta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly.

"AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me? **EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him.

"Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”? My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”.",Not the A-hole,jms4y3

"AITA for spending my son's university fund on a trip to Europe to drink beer like I always threatened instead of giving it to his step brother after he passed away. My son was smart. Smarter than me. I almost requested a paternity test because he was so damn intelligent. THAT IS A JOKE. 

My ex and I divorced when he was about 12. She remarried when he was 14. I did when he was 16. 

I had an RESP set up for him. That's a education fund in Canada. As long as he went for post secondary education he could use the money for anything. 

I always told him that I was okay with him not going to university. That way I could use the money I had saved up for him to go to Belgium and buy some beer from monks that only allow you to buy one case.

He knew I was joking and he always played along. He wouldn't let me get his goat. 

When he got accepted to McGill it was the proudest moment of my life. I took him out for a beer to celebrate his achievement and mourn the loss of my trip to Europe. 

My son was struck and killed by a drunk driver in March. I'm dealing with it. My ex is dealing with it. My wife has been nothing but my rock in this. She is holding me up. 

I was dealing with the funeral arrangements and everything when my ex came to talk to me about his money. She knew he had a scholarship and was just going to use the money for living expenses and an emergency fund. She asked me what I was going to do with it. 

I said I was going to do what I always said I would. I was going to Europe to drink beer. She asked if she could have it for her step son. I thought about it and said no. Her husband is a decent enough person but he made it clear that he wasn't responsible for any expenses for my son. Beyond food and shelter and stuff obviously. Like I said he is decent. 

I said I was not going to do that. I was going to go drink beer in my son's honour. 

She says I'm wasting thousands of dollars. And I guess I am. I have to give back the government portion of the fund. But I don't care.

Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&amp;#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

"AITA for throwing them out of a house that we own. Son and future In-Laws decide to exclude his family from wedding. They thought son owned the house not us. My wife and I bought a four bedroom house in PA that my son lives in.  Our son went to College in PA and wanted to stay in the area.  So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together. 

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.  

Now for the problem: The wedding !!! 

We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fiancé and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fiancé go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fiancé along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told ""We're not their kind of people"".  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.  

I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fiancé.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale. 

They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted. 

Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",Not the A-hole,vnl1hw
"AITA for telling cashier that wasn’t the girls credit card? 
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

"AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me? I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?",Not the A-hole,cohdqj
"AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters? I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.

A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). 

After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.

The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.

My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""

When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",Not the A-hole,htmhgb
"AITA for deleting my friend's wedding photos in front of them? I'm not really a photographer, I'm a dog groomer. I take lots of photos of dogs all day to put on my Facebook and Instagram, it's ""my thing"" if that makes sense. A cut and a photo with every appointment. I very seldom shoot things other than dogs even if I have a nice set up.

A friend got married a few days ago and wanting to save money, asked if I'd shoot it for them. I told him it's not really my forte but he convinced me by saying he didn't care if they were perfect: they were on a shoestring budget and I agreed to shoot it for $250, which is nothing for a 10 hour event. 

On the day of, I'm driving around following the bride as she goes from appointment to appointment before the ceremony, taking photos along the way. I shoot the ceremony itself, and during the reception I'm shooting speeches and people mingling.

I started around 11am and was due to finish around 7:30pm. Around 5pm, food is being served and I was told I cannot stop to eat because I need to be photographer; in fact, they didn't save me a spot at any table. I'm getting tired and at this point kinda regretting doing this for next to nothing. It's also unbelievably hot: the venue is in an old veteran's legion and it's like 110F and there's no AC.

I told the groom I need to take off for 20min to get something to eat and drink. There's no open bar or anything, I can't even get water and my two water bottles are long empty. He tells me I need to either be photographer, or leave without pay. With the heat, being hungry, being generally annoyed at the circumstances, I asked if he was sure, and he said yes, so I deleted all the photos I took in front of him and took off saying I'm not his photographer anymore. If I was to be paid $250, honestly at that point I would have paid $250 just for a glass of cold water and somewhere to sit for 5min.

Was I the asshole? They went right on their honeymoon and they've all been off of social media, but a lot of people have been posting on their wall asking about photos with zero responses.",Not the A-hole,po2kd8
"AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour? I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.

My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. 

Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.

I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything

Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.

I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.

So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. 

And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.

I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. 

Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.

I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.

My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.

Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

"AITA for speaking Italian to my GF's rude Italian American family and embarrassing them? **ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny

Backstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into ""testing"" the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying ""hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!"" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied ""then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language."" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.

"AITA for making a scene of my adult son and sticking my nose in his marriage I’m 60 and bad with the whole text thing on mobiles so I’m hoping I won’t be judged on my grammar 


Here’s the important background my daughter in law (32) and son(33) have 3 children aged 3 years 2 years and 4 months . He convinced her to be a stay at home mom and sell her business by telling her how good of a childhood he had and how happy my marriage was without telling her (which I today found out) that our arrangement was everything everything before 9am and
After 5pm was split 50/50, Sunday was my day off and I was brought out twice a week. 


On to the story- on my last visit I noticed my daughter in law was  struggling mentally so I,my sister(55f) and her girlfriend (53) pulled our money together and paid for a spa weekend for them while we’d babysit the kids for her birthday last weekend. 

I was preparing on Thursday evening  for the kids to arrive when my dil rang me holding back tears saying they’d won’t be going because my sons friend came to town and he said he wanted to spend the weekend with his friends catching up. I pressed her a little and I’m talking a little about her situation , she came clean about him doing no chores,no date nights and her basically doing all of the child care because “that’s what stay at home moms do” I was honestly disgusted. I convinced her to drop me off the kids and bring a friend to the spa I even dipped into my savings to give her €500 to buy herself something nice. When she dropped me off the kids I begged her to tell me were son was after 5 minutes she told me the bar. She left for the spa while I left for the bar (she knew I was going there and knew my sister/my sister in law were taking care of the kids) 

Here’s were I might be the asshole I when to the bar were he and his friends were, I sat down next to the Group and asked my son “did i fail you as a mother or was it your father because we both thought your partner comes before your silly drunk friends” the post is getting long enough but long story short I humiliated him and got myself banned from a bar 

My dil said she will taking the kids to her parents when she gets back tomorrow and my son is calling me an asshole for humiliating him/ sticking my nose in his marriage 
Maybe I should have stayed out i don’t know


Edit I just wanted to say I’m heartbroken not by any judgement towards me or my parenting skills but the fact a lot of people are shocked I’m care about my daughter in laws mental health and stood up for her against my sons bad  behaviour I just want to say as a mother my advice is

I went to a tattoo shop in my area, with a photo of the tattoo I wanted. It was one my dad had gotten to honor my passed grandfather who’s father also had it. But the point is - it was important to me that the tattoo looked EXACTLY as it did in the photo. 

I get to the shop, I explain everything, I pay, get the tattoo, and we’re done, I think it looks awesome, everything is great! Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She’s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, “Who’s AJ?” 

I ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I’m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it’s no big deal if I hadn’t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated.

I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting.

"AITA for not letting my miracle baby niece be my flower girl at my wedding? My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. 

Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. 

Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.

Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. 

So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.

She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.

She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should ""honor her"" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. 

Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said 

""Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?""

She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm ""letting her down"". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. 

Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.

"AITA for wearing a wedding dress at a wedding? So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.

A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn’t. I’m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.

I didn’t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.

After ten minutes my friend’s fiancé walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.

He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn’t know this was the wedding.

I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.

I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn’t bother her after that and the party soon ended.

I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.

That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.

She didn’t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it’s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.

I’ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn’t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.

So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?

"AITA for taking back the beer I bought for a party from which I was uninvited? This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. 

On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.

I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said ""thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!""

7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. 

I got back in the car and said ""let's party,"" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.

She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""thanks!"" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.

Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?",Not the A-hole,hd12gs
"AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does? Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?",Not the A-hole,d38i34
"AITA for calling out my kids’ future stepmom for treating me like a surrogate? I [29F] dated a guy Joe (30M) for 3 months before he left me to go back to his ex Kim (30F). Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I’m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he’s still with his girlfriend. 

Joe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children’s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. 

Kim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn’t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn’t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins “the non-traditional way” and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn’t even invited. She also announced that she’s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren’t hers, and that Joe didn’t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I’m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?

EDIT: I’m definitely getting a lawyer ASAP. Y’all have scared the shit out of me but I’m happy you did.

UPDATE: I never considered that this could’ve happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn’t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn’t my babies home state and I can’t be charged with anything. 
However, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don’t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.

Update: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there’s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.",Not the A-hole,mmxpzu
"AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single? This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. 

He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. 

Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. 

Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. 

Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol

Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband

Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important

Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. 

Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single

Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. 

AITA reddit?

Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.

Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" 

He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.""",Not the A-hole,icvnba
"AITA for not giving my sister her wedding dress because she didn't invited my underage son? I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. 

At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. 

The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. 

There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. 

She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. 

I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?


UPDATE: 

first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much. 

I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because ""she is family"". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit. 

At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it. 

And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fiancé who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me. 

And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that. 

If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",Not the A-hole,11e01qq

So, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.  Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.

I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

"AITA for kicking my SiL out after she threw away most of my single use baby products and even formula? I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're ""crunchy parents"" to a 8 month old.

Basically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea.

On Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing. 

When I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and ""threw out anything I don't need"". This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us.

I was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items.

"AITA for moving my son into a rental apartment after finding out that his dad's been cancelling his job applications? 
My son ""Aiden"" (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home.


So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him.


He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did.


[Edit] few things to mention:

(1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help.

(2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's.

(3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",Not the A-hole,103y282
"AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it? I fucking hate wedding culture.

It's bullshit.

My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

We put our foot down and said:

&gt;Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
&gt;  
&gt;Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing.

"AITA for my response to my sister's boyfriend's ""brutal honesty""? 


My F35 sister F27 started dating one of those ""brutally honest"" guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.


I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might ""produce"" defective babies due to age.


I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his ""honest opinion"" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: ""trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!"". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family.

"AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her. I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. 

She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. 

Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. 

My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. 

I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no.",Not the A-hole,d1btlg
"AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight? So here is the situation.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. 

AITA

Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. 

Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. 

Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",Not the A-hole,hxm71l
"AITA for not waking up my girlfriend for her exam after I overheard her calling me a little bitch? My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning. 

I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. 

She has joked that I’m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it’s ok so I didn’t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. 

However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn’t hear. She was bragging that I’m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like ‘good, put him in his place’ and she was agreeing. 

She specifically said ‘yeah I’m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I’m up and he’ll probably have breakfast ready for me too’ 

I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn’t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. 

When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I’m an asshole and I’ve cost her her exam and I’m a piece of shit for what I did.

EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can’t have my phone, work with food) I wasn’t expecting this many replies so fast. 

I think we’re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a ‘bitch’ for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she’s not done with me. 

I’m just trying to get through today’s shift and then deal with stuff later. I’ll try and get back as I can. We’ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I’m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small.",Not the A-hole,gth6bg
"AITA? I didn’t attend my son’s wedding, I instead spent the evening with his ex wife. Quick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy. 

After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn’t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there’s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem. 

They got into counseling, for a year things were ‘ok’ on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment. 

Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fiancée around our house out of respect for the mother of his children. 

The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn’t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid’s attended their father’s wedding. 

She was taken aback that I didn’t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she’ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night. 

The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.


*****ETA: First, I’d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can’t go back and undo that. 

So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work…DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her…”He’s dead to me now.” Time will tell if he means that. I’m sure he’ll see this update too. For that reason, I’m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won’t be dead anymore. 

His mom told him, “Your children have to be our number one priority.” They’re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he’ll understand this.",Not the A-hole,113xc1g
"AITA for getting upset with my husband after he told me nothing will change while I am pregnant? Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call ""Jake"" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",Not the A-hole,sgawl2
"WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty? My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?

"AITA for telling my boyfriend's friends I make twice what he does, when they called me a gold digger and he didn't defend me? I'm in a relationship with a guy who also works in tech. He makes 68k and I make 130k. I am a mechanical engineer at a robotics startup. He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company. 

He brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs.

I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. 

One of his friends asked about work and I said ""Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.""

I wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!  

Some other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out

I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer

It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.

He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. 

I got irritated with his friends and asked ""Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?"" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying ""There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? 

My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.

He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said ""at least they know I'm a rich bitch"" 

He was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense.

"AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable. My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. 

When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" 

This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. 

At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. 

I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. 

Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",Not the A-hole,hzjbhx
"AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry? This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

This wouldn't be a problem except she doesn't visit for an evening. She will come for a week. And for that week I'm an unpaid nanny.

I asked who was going and they said it was just the three of us. 

But when we got to the airport my sister and her family were there. Strangely enough they were also going to Disneyland. 

I went into my backpack and grabbed my passport. I put it in my sock. 

When we got to the international security I couldn't find it. We looked everywhere.  I had to Uber home and I missed my flight. Oh well. I get to stay home by myself for a week of peace and quiet. 

My parents were very mad at me for losing my passport. The money they spent on my flight and entrance was wasted. Darn. 

My mom and sister have both been posting about how hard it is to be at Disneyland with two little ones. They both posted that I ruined the vacation by being so thoughtless. 

My dad says he knows why I did and he understands. But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse.

"AITA for telling my friend her parents bought her house, not her? The title sounds bad but hear me out. 

Backstory: I (F28) have a friend (F28) who purchased a house late last year. It's an awesome 2 story town house and I've been over there plenty of times to help out with moving/decorating and for hanging out. As mentioned in the title, her parents purchased the house for her and her partner. I truly have no issue with this as the housing market is terrible for buyers so more power to them for being home owners. I recently, unfortunately inherited my parents house, which is 3 bedroom, out in the sticks. 

The issue: We went appliance shopping because most of the the stuff in the house was 10-15 years old. We were standing with an employee who I had asked to recommend some smaller items like toasters and kettles when the employee asked if I was moving out as general chit chat. I told him I was moving, and he asked whether I bought or rented. I told him bought, because it was just easier and less awkward than telling him I inherited the house. He told me that was cool and began talking about the toasters again when my friend cut in that I had inherited my house, not purchased it. The employee went quiet and I gave her a ""what was that"" face. I was taken aback, she continued on saying ""Yeah, *I* purchased my house"". I asked ""does it really matter? I'm here to buy some kitchen appliances not tell this guy my personal issues."" She grinned and said ""it's just for the record"" which made me more confused and annoyed. (You can probably see where this is going) I replied ""Oh okay then if it's just for the record your parents purchased your house for you."" The employee quickly retreated and she walked outside of the shop. I caught up with her and she said I was a massive asshole for pointing out she couldn't afford to own without her parents help. I returned with a very similar ""my parents also helped me with getting a house too, just in a really terrible way."" My partner agrees with me, saying that she's the one that opened that door, but our other friends are split almost 50/50.

----

My friend ""Grace"" invited me to a board game bar to play and have drinks with her, her boyfriend and one of their friend's ""Nick"".

We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us. 

Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. 

He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying ""sorry, you don't understand that, haha"". During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining. 

When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. ""Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary."" I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted. 

At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. 

He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. 

I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. 

He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can’t be flushed and that it’s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. 

I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she’s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. 

This is a genuine issue to me and she didn’t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don’t see how I’m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA?

UPDATE — Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive “periods for pricks” course, Powerpoint and all. It was a hoot, they made an interactive quiz and everything. My sons and I learned a lot and apologised to my stepdaughter. Thankyou for your input",Asshole,h0a45w
"AITA for doing weird/awkward poses whenever my MIL ""accidently"" walks in on me in the bathroom? So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.


The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.


She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming ""she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel ""terrified/weirded out"" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.


Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a ""me problem"" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it 😅🤣 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow. Especially after what happened. Lol.",Not the A-hole,z3jp34
"AITA for not accepting my sister's relationship with my ex despite her having cancer as a teenager? My (25F) father married my step-sister's (23F) mother when I was 4 and she was 3. We've lived together most of our lives and are a family. She and I were extremely close.

She developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. She's since made a full recovery. During that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. They also asked a lot of me. I quit my extracurriculars so I could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so I could drive her to appointments. I didn't go to dances and any fun activities I did needed to include her. I did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - I did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. And I think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.

Anyhow, I go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him Ben, when I'm a junior. We fall in love, blah blah blah. He and I move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. We were serious until July when I walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.

I broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. My sister apologized at first but then backed off. I thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. She told me that she and Ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. Distraught,  I left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. She later venmo'ed me asking for the money.

She told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with Ben. They brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. I don't buy this, in part because I've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that I should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. They then told me that if I don't accept my sister and Ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. I reminded them that I'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.

For the record: I'm not jealous of her. I'm not upset that Ben picked her over me. I'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that I don't want to be with a cheater. What I'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose Ben over me. That she slept with Ben knowing he and I were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.

Now no one in my immediate family is talking to me and I'm getting messages from aunts and uncles and cousins telling me that I'm an asshole and a selfish bitch.

Edit: Thank you everyone so much for your comments. This has gotten more attention than I expected and am having trouble keeping up, so if I don't say thank you, then thank you. I've been given a lot of food for thought. TBH, while I've had moments where I've been resentful or upset about my teenage years, I've always thought that I did the right thing for my sister and for my family. And that time wasn't all miserable; I was very close to my sister and we made things as fun as we could. But I didn't think of it as an abdication of my parent's responsibilities or that they were doing wrong by me, which many of you pointed out. I definitely have a lot to think about.

Thank you again for making me feel less crazy about all of this!

UPDATE: Sometimes you can only laugh. Just got off of the phone with my cousin who saw this post and said he could explain a few things. I asked him why he was on Reddit instead of school, he asked me why I was on Reddit instead of work, and I said touché. He told me that after my conversation with my mom, she went to his house and talked to my aunt. And here's the deal:

Turns out my sister is not only in a relationship with Ben but **FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT**. Which means she and Ben were fucking for longer than I had even guessed. Apparently my parents are so adamant that I forgive her because I'm already ruining their experience of their first grandchild. That's right, I'm less important than my stepmom posting ultrasounds to Facebook. This is where we're at.

"AITA for telling an employee she can choose between demotion or termination? I own a vape shop. We're a small business, only 12 employees.  

One of my employees, Peggy, was supposed to open yesterday. Peggy has recently been promoted to Manager, after 2 solid years of good work as a cashier. I really thought she could handle the responsibility.  

So, I wake up, 3 hours after the place should be open, and I have 22 notifications on the store Facebook page. Customers have been trying to come shop, but the store is closed. Employees are showing up to work, but they're locked out.   

I call Peggy, and get no response. I text her, same thing. So I go in and open the store. An hour before her shift was supposed to be **over**, she calls me back.  

I ask her if she's ok, and she says she needed to ""take a mental health day and do some self-care"". I'm still pretty pissed at this point, but I'm trying to be understanding, as I know how important mental health can be. So I ask her why she didn't call me as soon as she knew she needed the day off. Her response: ""I didn't have enough spoons in my drawer for that."".  

Frankly, IDK what that means. But it seems to me like she's saying she cannot be trusted to handle the responsibility of opening the store in the AM.  

So I told her that she had two choices:  

1) Go back to her old position, with her old pay.  

2) I fire her completely.  

She's calling me all sorts of ""-ist"" now, and says I'm discriminating against her due to her poor mental health and her gender. 

None of this would have been a problem if she simply took 2 minutes to call out. I would have got up and opened the store on time. But this no-call/no-show shit is not the way to run a successful business. 

I think I might be the AH here, because I **am** taking away her promotion over something she really had no control over.  

But at the same time, she really could have called me.

"AITA for telling my parents that they ruined NY celebration after they kicked my husband out over a joke? 
I've been married to my 2nd Husband ""Mike"" for 4 years now. He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother ""Ethan"" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.


Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy ""Joey"" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.


So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said ""Knock knock.."" Ethan laughed and said ""Who's there?"". Mike replied ""Joey's bio parents"" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an ""idiot"" to which Mike replied with ""Hey...Relax it was just a joke"". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.

"AITA my classmate ""saved goldfish"" by releasing them into the ocean, I called her a dumbass My classmate recently made a tiktok and she showed a group of people at lunch time it. They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say ""hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out"" and in it she explains how she ""rescued"" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free. 

I was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said ""you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen"" her friend says ""well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?"" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her.

"AITA for checking my husband's dashcam footage on his car without his consent I (34F) live with my husband (37M) and daughter (7F). 

My daughter and I recently went on a short trip out of state while my husband stayed as he had work and was supposed to look after our dog. 

On the last day of our trip we got a call from my husband who was acting distraught and said that our dog Ellie had run away and that he could not find her. He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.

Our dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.

When we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.

A few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.

I told my husband and he just said ""that is great, I am so happy"" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.

When he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.

I was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",Not the A-hole,15hnt2x
"AITA for kicking my cousin off of my sister’s wedding Zoom call? My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fiancé [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can’t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a “Zoom” wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fiancé. 

My sister didn’t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. 

She and her fiancé decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fiancé and quote “overshadow” them on their big day “that was already scaled down”. However, her and her fiancé said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. 

Fast-forward to the day of the wedding—everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they’d like to talk so it doesn’t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he’s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He’s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like “(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it’s given me the courage to do this....” then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??

I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he’s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I’s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. 

The rest of the wedding went smoothly—except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??",Not the A-hole,hx80wd
"AITA for refusing to punish or allow my wife to punish our son? This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.

My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.

I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.

I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to ""even the score.""

"AITA for yelling at my parents that their polyamory fucked up my childhood? EDIT: to all of you who DMed me to tell me about how fucking great polyamory is and that you're mad I gave it a bad name, you have issues if that's what you take away from this post

I believe it started when I was around 6 years old. My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.

They gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. 

I always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. 

A while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'. Even though I tried to, it's like I can't reply, this argument brought something very emotional up in me.

It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed.

"AITA for refusing to forgive my Dad for breaking our deal? When I (17 M) was 8, my parents bought me a piano and signed me up for lessons. I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town.

When I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.

I should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs.

I should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair.

So, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.

A couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, ""A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!"" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.

Ever since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

"AITA for returning a birthday gift I got for my boyfriend after he insulted me about my “colorful” past? **UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGE**

This happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. 

I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. 

He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We’ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn’t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. 

Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. 

I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn’t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. 

After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.

I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn’t bother him.

Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.

His best female friend Jessica laughed and said “I wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.”

I looked at her with an “excuse me?” Look on my face and she just said “nevermind” and walked away. 

I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote “she’s just messing with you. You can’t take a joke?”

So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said “well, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.” 

I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said “you know…messing with best friends?” 

He then pat me on the shoulder and said that it’s okay because I’m not who I was back then and if he could get over my “colourful past” and “thot mentalities” to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica’s comments and give her another chance.

I didn’t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.

He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn’t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.

I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they’re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. 

I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn’t a “thot” and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. 

He started screaming how I’m “the biggest AH” for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my “colourful past.” 

I’m thinking maybe taking it back went too far.

"AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I've given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.


Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.


I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I've spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts.",Not the A-hole,gcr7vr
"AITA for leaving significant facial scarring uncovered on a plane and being confrontational when a father asked me to cover it because it was scaring his son? 
I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. 

In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.

But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.

This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.

I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. 

It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.

So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.

I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... 

His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" 

I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. 

He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""

I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""

He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. 

He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.

"AITA for embarrassing my FIL after I repeatedly asked him to explain his joke to me?  I (27F) used to be an ''*escort*'' (h\*oker) from 18 until I was 23, I'm not proud of it but I also don't give a fuck because I did what I had to do to keep studying and a roof over my head. That's how I met my now fiancé (37M) tho he was never my client.

We began to date when I was 25 and three or four months after that his BIL ''exposed me'' (no idea how he found out) because *there's no way my fiancé knew* and thus we had to come clean in front of his whole family. Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fiancés aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fiancé shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us.

He proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fiancés child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''.

Well, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fiancé got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left. 

Later my fiancé's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised. Now they're all demanding that I apologize to my FIL.",Not the A-hole,tripxr
"AITA for not telling my wife that I picked her daughter up drunk from a house party? I'm going to try to keep this short and simple. I always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before, I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We're only human and it's a part of life.

I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash.

I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other ""work"" for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.

Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. 

I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.

So I threw her out.

"AITA for faking sleeping all night to see if my wife is lying? The past couple of months, my wife has been complaining about our cats. She’s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she’s frustrated every night that she “has to get up and open the door for the cats” or “the cats keep making noises” or “the cats keep jumping on her.” It got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. I told her I’ve never seen or heard any of this, but she claims I sleep through it all.

She kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if I didn’t get rid of them, she’d leave me. I legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until I noticed something.

One morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. She listed a bunch of times. I thought it was weird, because I had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she “got up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.” I was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and I know none of that happened. Things weren’t adding up, so I decided to run a test.

I waited until she said she was going to bed, then I let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. I just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but I definately did not fall asleep. I made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through Discord just to be sure. I marked down every noise my cats made. One cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. Other than that, nothing happened.

Sure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up “at least 7 times” to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. At this point I was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. I was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so I just bluntly called her out on it.

I told her, “That’s funny. I stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren’t even in the room at all last night. I have timestamps and everything. So you’ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? Why?” She just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. She came back hours later and ignored me whenever I talked, and when I asked her how **I’m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that I was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if I was an investigator was “going too far” and makes me an obsessive asshole.

I did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she’d leave me, and her claims didn’t add up.

So, am I an “obsessive asshole?”


**UPDATE:**

My wife has been Baker Acted. She did not hurt herself, just said something concerning in public.

I got a call from the hospital this morning, asking me to head over for some “family therapy.” Apparently she finally wanted to talk.

I’ll be honest, I’m pretty pissed at the reason why she’s been so hateful towards my cats. It’s absolutely asinine.

It’s nothing that anyone had suggested. *She’s not cheating. She’s not sick physically or mentally. She’s not bored of the relationship and looking for an “out.”*

According to her, ***one of the cats stepped on her laptop and ruined a story she was writing.*** She’s hated both cats ever since. I mean that sucks, but it’s not worth trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting rid of them.

I asked her why she didn’t just tell me the truth and why she’d been lying and refused to talk about it when I’d asked. Her answer was “Because you wouldn’t have gotten rid of them otherwise.” and explained that when she saw I wasn’t willing to abandon them for her, she took offense and made it a “goal” to have me pick her over them.

Sickening. Don’t know why she actually admitted to it all.

The woman with us asked me how I felt about all of it, and I just told the truth. I told her it was a nice run, but I’m ***probably*** going to want a divorce. I was asked why, and I told them. I’ve seen a new hateful, malicious side of her that I want nothing to do with. She was so set on getting rid of the cats over a *fanfiction* being ruined that she manipulated her husband.

My wife started shouting at me that I’ve betrayed her and that I’m “scum” for choosing animals over her. At least cats don’t give ultimatums like she gave.

It sucks that she’s been Baker Acted and all I guess, but it’s for the best right now. She’ll have time to process it all in a safe environment and hopefully come to terms with it. Bad husband, I know.

I’m almost sure I’m going for divorce. I’m very worried about having her in the same house as my cats. I want my cats safe. I don’t want to worry about them being harmed or “disappearing.” Screw that.

I guess I’ll do what almost all of you suggested: “Keep the cats, rehome the wife.” Not how I *wanted* it to end, but life isn’t always nice.

**If I may, I want to clear up some things from the original post:**

***I did not stare at her all night.*** We have a mute TV with subtitles playing every night. I subtly watched TV while paying attention to the cat sounds.

***I’m not allowed to install cat doors, and she won’t let me keep the doors open.*** Apartment rules.

***Why did I instantly assume she was lying?*** I’m unfamiliar with mental health/diseases. I know about some diseases, but ones that make you think your dreams happened? Tumors that make you see/hear/remember nonexistent things? Sorry that I wasn’t aware of those possibilities. So when someone tells me events happened when they literally didn’t, I generally assume they’re lying. Shame on me.

"AITA for telling my wife it’s not ‘cute’ for her to encourage our teenage daughter to expect her boyfriend to pay for EVERYTHING in their relationship? Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. 

He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can’t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she’s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  

My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. 

Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. 

Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. 

I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. 

However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ 

I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it’s not cute for her to be thinking it’s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",Not the A-hole,gnkxa5

Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF.

"AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse? Hi all. 

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?

Please do NOT comment yet, read this:

Ok I don’t know how to explain this without being misunderstood but could you guys do me a small favor? I used a throwaway account for privacy reasons but the thing is, if this post blows up, there is a high chance for my friend to still see this. Could you please instead of commenting, DM me if your judgement is ‘YTA’? I promise if I get a lot of YTA dms I am going to ACCEPT the judgement as per rule 3 but it’s just weird if my friend sees this and sees ‘YTA’ comments especially after our last argument, you guys get what I mean right? Thank you.

EDIT: Oh cmon guys. This post if 1 in rising now. Can't you please do as I asked you? Would you be ok posting on this subreddit just to get comments full of YTA and your friends see them and laugh at you?

EDIT: Hey mods! Please check your inbox as I sent you a message. It's urgent.

EDIT: Ok the mods responded about automod and they basically told me to suck it up and deal with it wth? Guys please just do as I asked you. I accept my judgement",Asshole,hzden5
"AITA for admitting I regret having children. My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). 

Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". 

I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. 

My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.

Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. 

It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. 
 
AITA for saying it though?

Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. 

When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. 

Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  

Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. 

My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.

Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",Not the A-hole,e7t57k
"AITA for not paying to change my father's gravely insulting gravestone? My father and mother had a very bitter marriage towards the end of his life, he had a long running affair with another married co-worker and got her pregnant before he passed. He was planning to leave mom, skip the country and move to Canada to start a new life with her. They had a house picked out and all. 

He had moved out and was living with his co-worker when he suddenly died of a heart attack while having sex. Divorce papers were never filed, no legal separation. They were in the process of moving all things legal. But on paper, they were still happily married. 

Now me and my siblings are already out of home, our youngest sibling is 19 and is in college. I work for a tech company and I'm currently back in my hometown helping my mom manage his estate. 

Well, my mom was hurt and petty and marked his gravestone as ""In loving memory of John Doe, son, husband, father and adulterer.""

My dad's family and his pregnant partner are mad and want me to fix it.

"AITA flipping out on my fiance for cancelling all the vegan food options from our wedding food menu behind my back? 

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads &amp; appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

"AITA for kicking out my girlfriend So I have a cat named Raven who's 3 years old.

My girlfriend of 2 years moved in with me a few weeks ago and it was clear she didn't like my cat.

I didn't think it was really a big deal until one day I got home and he was just gone. He's not an outdoor cat and he never goes outside. 

He was gone for hours and I was worried sick until my buddy came to my house and returned him, saying he found him 2 blocks from my house.

I asked my girlfriend how my cat, who has never tried to go out before ended up that far from my house and she admitted to kicking him out.

I was furious, saying she had no right to kick him out and told her that since she thought she had the power to kick my cat out, I wanted her out of my house by the end of the month.

She cried that she had nowhere to go and that she would have to live on the streets. I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month.

"AITA for suggesting/letting my 17 year old son get drunk? I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.

My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.

I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a ""test run"" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.

We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.

I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his ""first experience"" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.

"AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job? I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.

We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. 

A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.

She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.

I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. 

It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.

I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)

Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.

I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. 

However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.

I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. 

She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.

"AITA for taking my newborn son and going to my mom's house because my husband his mom didn't save me any food for dinner? 



I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.

I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself ""well, at least she cooks for us!"".


Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was ""probably"" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said ""Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry"". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't ""show up for dinner"" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said ""I don't know, maybe save some food for me?"" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life ""on pause"" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.


He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me ""nuts"" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over ""food"".



**Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**


**one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**








**Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he ""can't come"" see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came**


**Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me ""for real this time"" ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!**


**Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also ""talk"" (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",Not the A-hole,xicqfv
"AITA for asking my husband to turn down his dream job for my career? 
I’m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.  

I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M’s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we’re held to strict standards.  

My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. 

This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can’t be detailed). However, it’s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. 

My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn’t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.

It’d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don’t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. 

I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we’d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. 

He was extremely angry, and said I was “selfish and only cared about money.” I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn’t possible. 

He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn’t being a supportive wife. 

I feel so betrayed, and I’ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it’s better coming from my email than from a background check. 

I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. 

I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It’s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time.",Not the A-hole,ii4zpu
"AITA for telling off my MIL for insisting my daughter doesn't have a ""real"" vagina? My 4.5 yo daughter has a stomach bug, and has been having some diarrhea. My wife needed to take our son to an appt nd I needed to WFH today so my MIL came to watch after our daughter.

My daughter needed to use the bathroom, and I was going to excuse myself from my online meeting but my MIL said she had it. A bit later, my daughter came up to me and asked me to wipe her. I said to her, didn't Grandma help you? (She knows how to wipe, but with her having diarrhea we're helping her). She said yes, but Grandma wiped wrong. She said Grandma wiped in instead of out. (We've taught her to wipe out instead of in.)

I excused myself from my meeting to help wipe my daughter correctly. I went to find my MIL in the kitchen. I asked her, [daughter] says you wiped in instead of out? She said, I wiped her, you think there's a better way? I told her it's not healthy to wipe into the vagina, you need to wipe out. She said, and you have a vagina? I said no, but I have a daughter, and I won't let her get an infection by wiping poop into her vagina. She said, [daughter] doesn't have a real vagina yet, there's no chance of infecting anything. I said, what...? Of course she has a real vagina, she's a female. She said, girls don't have real vaginas until their teenagers. And that there's no chance of any infection because their vagina doesn't actually develop until they're a teenager. I was... dumbfounded. And I got angry.

I said to her, ""You're a woman, you raised three daughters, I'm married to one... you can't possibly be this stupid?"" 

She told me I'm out of line and said if I can't appreciate her help then she's leaving. I told her I'm perfectly, in fact definitely more capable than her of caring for my daughter, and that she's welcome to get out. She did leave, and about ten minutes layer my wife called me and said her mom was furious with me and said I was terrible to her and made her leave without any reason.

"AITA for setting a glitter trap to catch my mother in law trying to snoop? For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. 

However, she’s still always “forgetting” where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we’ve put locks on the rooms we don’t want her in, there isn’t really a problem anymore.  

Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn’t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  

I did this once before when husband didn’t believe me about the snooping to prove she’d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn’t say anything about it but then my husband couldn’t deny that she’d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. 

Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There’s a  baby gate so the kids can’t get upstairs either. 

Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I’m the asshole.

"AITA for honking at another driver who cut in front of me at a drive thru each time she tries to order This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me. I laid on the horn and tried to block her from cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off. 

Okay. I’m the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day. 

I just can’t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn’t simply let this go.

"AITA For ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name? I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

"AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth? A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.

We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.

Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""

Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.

I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" 

Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""

If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",Not the A-hole,i34mdp
"AITA for pretending not to recognize my parents when they tried to reconnect? I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt.  My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn’t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn’t even explain to me what was going on, just “you’re going to go visit gran for awhile” and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I’ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can’t have kids so they’ve always said I’m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I’m 21 now.

My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn’t want to so he told them that I wasn’t available at the moment.

They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said “Sorry, do I know you?” They said “We’re your parents!” and I said “My parents are at home.” and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like “You really don’t recognize us?” And I said “Oh, are you my dad’s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.”

My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they’ll always be my parents and I can’t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they’re grieving, but I don’t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.",Not the A-hole,109jid0
"AITA For skipping Christmas with my parents since they won't treat me like an adult? I (F27) have been with my boyfriend (33) for almost two years now.  We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. 

My mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  

My boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  

We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  

I am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  

I may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  

They took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. 

Now they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. But I miss my dad and he is blameless in this.

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of things that keep being repeated.

"AITA for deleting my son's Minecraft world? I have 2 children, a 9 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me.

Since school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.

So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again.

"AITA for pretending to be an ""Appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me? I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank.

"AITA for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her African American boyfriend to her grandparents? Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

"AITA for telling my step-dad and mom that they shouldn't be surprised at what my little brother said to them when they pulled a prank on him? I \[20 F\] am an older sister to my little (biological) brother (17 M) who finished high school last year. My little brother and I are really close. He says I'm the best friend he has and he loves me more than anyone (of course this is not true, he has many friends of his own).

My brother has been asking our step-dad/mother if he could get a new car for his grad party since last year, and he said he'd pay 50-75% with his own hard-earned money while they paid the rest. They said no. I have a car but I had been working for one, they helped me pay off for it. So my brother's arguments with our parents got heated after awhile (one time I told my brother that I'd help him pay off expenses for a good car once I got my own. He hugged me and said I didn't need to worry and that he owed me way more than I owed him). But he continued to press our parents all of last year until they gave in and said yes like they did for me.

Note that our step-dad and my brother have a negative relationship for the most part. Our bio mother and step-dad got together soon after our bio dad and mom divorced when we were little. My brother thinks that step-dad and mother were seeing each other before our real parents divorced and tbh, I think that might be true. Not certain, though.

Anyway, my step-dad, mother and brother compromised and said they'd get him the car in 2021 so that people don't gawk at him at the graduation party. June this year my brother and step-dad/mother are still on about the car, now the arguments getting loud and lasting hours until evening. My step-dad was getting into screaming matches with my brother over it but they reached a final compromise of the car being bought last week. 

The fated morning comes and my brother wakes up to our step-dad and mom guiding him outside to... a car. But not his, our mother's. Step-dad used his and my brother's money on a dumb prank, bought a completely different model of car, and said it was for our mother. Our mom and step dad just laughed and kissed each other. My brother didn't lose it, he didn't even look angry. He just looked dead in our step-dad's eyes and said, and I'm not joking, verbatim: ""you might think I'm fucking stupid, you might think whatever. But I'm just better than you, bro. You know that, I know that, and our mom is a fucking idiot for staying with a prick like you. But I'll make you wish you'd never fucking met us. I promise you. You might be laughing now, but you'll be crying later."" He then walked off, not even looking back at them as they stared horrified.

They asked me what was that about and I, feeling terrible for my brother, said they had it coming and not to be surprised. So now they grounded both of us. I've had to explain the situation to my friends as I can't see them anymore but I feel so bad for my baby brother and they back me up on this and ask me to comfort him as much as possible. But our parents are so mad, and they can't see that my brother had his heart crushed. AITA?",Not the A-hole,okzq0t
"AITA for my reaction when I learned that my fiance returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom picked for me? My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.


Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

"AITA for going to the police over a 'prank' Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.

Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like ""Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""Awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""

"AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight? My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

"AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night? What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I’ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can’t find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",Asshole,ca7bdz
"AITA for telling my fiancé if I see her friend again I’m calling the cops. Edit: Update. I want to thank you all for the kind words and comments. I knew after reading the comments that it was time to come to a resolution. I decided to drive home from work and talk with Erica. When I showed up Leah’s car was parked in the drive. I went inside and they were watching tv. I told Leah immediately to get out, she tried to argue but I told her if she didn’t then I’m calling the police. Erica tried to get pissy that I kicked her friend out but I said I’m done talking about Leah because at this point nothing is changing with that relationship. Sat Erica down and showed her this post. 20 minutes of reading later I asked her what she thought, she said “those people don’t understand our relationship or Leah”. I knew then that it was over. I asked her to hold out her hand and I took the ring off. She begged saying she is sorry and she’ll cut Leah off etc. I told her I can’t even trust her with the garage code, how am I supposed to trust her as my wife. She’s locked herself in our room now. I’m in the kitchen packing up her things. I called her dad/mom telling them about what has happened and they were furious. Leah is apparently banned from their house and has been since HS. I didn’t know this but her parents said it’s been like this since Hs. They are coming this weekend to get Erica and the stuff. I couldn’t be any happier than I am right now. A huge weight feels lifted off my shoulders. I felt like if I never made this post I wouldn’t have ever seen how messed up my life had become. Sincerely thank you everyone. Can’t wait to take my clubs out and play a round now that I have more free time. Really excited to see what single life brings and can’t thank you all enough again. 



Me (29M) and Erica (27F) dated for 2 years and have been engaged the last 4 months. After we got engaged Erica moved into my house. I still pay the mortgage while she pays for utilities, Groceries and household items. After we get married the plan is to put her on the house so she gets equity as well. Her friend Leah (27F) and her have been best friend since high school. I don’t particularly like Leah but have also been cordial as I know she’s gonna be in my life. My issue is Leah thinks of my home as hers. Couple examples…

She always brings her boyfriend over and he’s a sketchball. She talks to me in a very disrespectful way in my own house, like I’m a guest and she/Erica own it. One day I went out to my garage and some of my tools were missing. I checked my camera and Leah/BF were in my garage with Erica and took some tools with them. I asked Erica and she said they were just borrowing and would return them. I had to reach out multiple times for them to finally return the tools weeks later. I have a nice wine/liquor collection and I was working late one Friday. While working I heard some clanking of bottles together. Erica wasn’t home so I went out to see what was up. Leah was behind my bar. I asked what she was doing and she said that Erica told her it was okay to borrow a bottle of wine for her party and that she would pay it back. I told her no that wasn’t alright and to leave. I asked Erica about this and she said “I don’t remember telling Leah she could take a bottle but I might have I don’t remember”. I told her at this point I wasn’t comfortable with Leah being in my house, Erica sorta understood but also blew me off. 

Final straw came when I wanted to go hit some golf balls and my clubs were missing. I freaked out because i golf regularly and my clubs are my biggest investment. Went to check the camera again and Leah used my garage code and took the clubs. I blew up, called Erica and told her to get them back immediately. Erica said Leah had asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet and not my clubs. I threatened to call the police but Erica stopped me. Leah kept telling us that her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. I got them back almost 4 days after they were taken and they were dirty. At this point I sat Erica down and told her that if I see Leah in my house again then I’m calling the cops, no discussion. Erica got upset saying that it’s her best friend and that wasn’t fair to do to her in our house. I said it’s a pattern and since Erica’s stuff isn’t affected she doesn’t care. I said she can go over to Leah’s if she wants to see her. She said she can’t do this because Leah doesn’t like her apartment and Leah’s BF is always there which makes Erica uncomfortable. I’m now getting the silent treatment and getting called an AH but I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong. AITA?",Not the A-hole,rijyk1
"AITA for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her? I know the title sounds absolutely terrible. 
 
My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since ""I've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". We broke up.
 
The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it.
 
But alas, AITA?
 
No. I did not cheat on her.
 
Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after.",Not the A-hole,dwrlls
"AITA for doing the same thing to my sister-in-law that she does to my son? So background: I (32f) have a brother, ""Dave"" (35m), who's married to ""Sarah"" (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.

My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.

Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ""ignoring my son's obvious speech issues."" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.

This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in ""bad"" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, ""Pass *us* the peas, will you"". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.

Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.

Should I just apologise?

**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**

**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to ""keep the peace""). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**

**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**

**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",Not the A-hole,xxznvl
"AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to? My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed.

"AITA for giving FMIL 3 days to pay me for a new wedding dress or else I show the family a photo of her wearing it? 

So, I'm getting married to my fiance soon. I bought my wedding dress weeks ago. His my (FMIL) kept pestering me about trying it on but I firmly refused. I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her ""love"" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.


Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.

I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.


AITA?


Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can ""end the conflict"" but he wants me to :

* hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.
* Swear that I don't have any copies to ""use"" against his mom later.
* Apologize to his mom.
* And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.

I haven't responded yet.

P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it.

"AITA for telling my husband that his culture is garbage and I won't ""compromise"" by incorporating it into our family life? My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. “John” moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John’s parents AND his childhood best friend “Dan” and his wife decided to move here as well.

This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a “distanced picnic” at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to “jokingly” rip on him for being “whipped” and doing “my” job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be “allowed” to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how “mean” I was for not “fixing him a plate” and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families ""do it right"", where they handle the “outside chores” while their wives handle the “inside chores” (including the care of Dan and his wife’s two children). I think it’s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have “outdoor chores”, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.

The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to “go for a walk” and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for “making \[him\] look bad” in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how “a traditional division of labor” is “a huge part of southern culture”, and how I was being “disrespectful” to his background by “forcing northern culture” onto him and his family. He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.

I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how ""southern hospitality"" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. 

John is livid and says his ""culture"" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not ""compromising"" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his ""culture"" was ""Islamic or Asian or whatnot"".",Not the A-hole,i79ikq
"AITA? My mom is an influencer. I am sick of being a part of it, I had ""NO PHOTOS"" hoodies printed for me and my little sister. I am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. 

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.

I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.

""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking

But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.

And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. 

I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.

I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree

"AITA for hiding embarrassing notes in my house as a joke because I know my fiance's mom snoops? I bought a house seven years ago and I met my fiance, Al, four years ago This year he moved in. We're talking about making it a home for both of us.

But as of now, he hasn't moved much stuff in, right now 95% of the stuff and furniture in the house is mine. 

When his mom comes over, she's kind of a snoop. He was used to that, but when she comes to our house, it's so uncomfortable because she's just going through my shit. 

When I am bothered, she's like ""I was just helping with chores"" etc. He says I should just let her because she has ""a lot of nervous energy"" 

One thing she snooped on was actually embarrassing. In my home office, I had a little ""affirmation"" post it note on my monitor saying ""I am smart, I am skilled, I am deserving of great things"" It was a silly thing my therapist recommended to get me in a confident mindset before an interview. 

Anyway, she made a comment to about my ego... 

But as a joke, I decided to do it again. I had my best friend over and we got wine drunk and wrote a bunch of ""affirmations"" to hide.

Some were:

Medicine cabinet: My teeth will regrow! I am sharklike and powerful!

Kitchen drawers: I know when to spoon, but I also know when to fork! I am sexy and self assured!

Work desk: I will not just fuck my way to the top of the company, I will fuck my way to the top of the world! 

Walk in closet: I am beautiful with clothes and without! Especially without! My boobs are legendary!


There were a bunch more, and my friend and I had a hilarious time writing them. 

Next time my MIL came over she saw a few. And she didn't acknowledge them to me even though she definitely started acting a little weird about me. 

I went to run some errands and when I was out, she confronted Al about the notes and was trying to tell him that I seemed unstable, egotistical, and moving in was a bad idea. She showed him the notes and he didn't really know what to make of it. 

He asked me and I said that they were just some silly private notes to boost my self confidence and make myself laugh; how had she gotten them? Had she been going through my things? 

He said she was just tidying, and saw them. And they were real weird.

I was like 'have you met me? You should know how weird I am. Anyway if you don't want your mom seeing my weird shit you've got to stop letting her go through my shit""

He asked if I left them on purpose to annoy her, and I admitted that was kinda the joke, but I also have other weird or private shit so what I said about her needing to stop snooping if she didn't want to find weird crap was still for real.

He said I was making stuff hard for him, his mom was really protective and adjusting to him moving in with a girlfriend for the first time, and I was agitating her on purpose and making her think I wouldn't be a good partner, when he wanted her to have the opposite impression of me!

"aita for ruining my sister’s wedding. Throwaway account and please don’t repost anywhere else. 

I (24f) was with my ex fiancé N (27) since I was 13 and he was 15. He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. 

We always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner’s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. 

We were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. 

We decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn’t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. 

Turns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. 

I’m regretting getting drunk now because i’m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ?

"AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage? I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy &amp; support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",Not the A-hole,briguv

I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.

My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. 

He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. 

Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",Not the A-hole,t2z9oa
"AITA for moving out when my parents asked me to pay rent. I 23 am the oldest of five siblings and I am a full time student. I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  

Both of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  

My dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  

Over Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  

My parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  

I went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  

I packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  

I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  

I just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  

My oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  

My parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  

I'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    

I feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.

#EDIT

All the chores were split fairly.  I wasn't doing any more than anyone else.  I thought it was fair until I was asked to out in money as well.",Not the A-hole,10sr0wi
"AITA for cancelling my son's birthday party upon discovering that he ruined his stepbrother's deceased brother's hoodie? 
It's a complex situation but I'll do my best to explain.

I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say ""OK I get it"" and ""I won't do it again"".

Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.

Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said ""so what, maybe this will help him move on in life"". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.
He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.

"AITA for getting upset that my sister’s fiancé pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding? The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. 

Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. 

He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. 

At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”

I just went to go find a seat after that. 

After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” 

I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"AITA for giving my dad his money back in front of his other kids and telling him he was no longer welcome at my graduation? My graduation ceremony is being held next week. My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.

Dad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.

When I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.

In 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.

Dad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.

"AITA for replacing myself with my twin brother at my in-laws’ Christmas Eve party to see if anyone noticed? I am 31, and have an identical twin brother. For a while I’ve told my wife that none of her family members notice me or care about anything I do on Christmas Eve but they insist on me attending. She told me that’s not true, they genuinely like me and enjoy talking to me. But I know that the only times they’ve included me I had to basically insert myself into conversations and it feels awkward and unnatural. 

So I had a wager with my wife. Bring my twin brother Steve instead of me, and see if anyone notices. I purposefully did not prep Steve on anything, he went in completely clueless (he knew why we were doing it and was game. I gave him $20.)  

As I suspected, Steve confirmed that he wasn’t approached all night, nobody could tell he wasn’t me, and he admitted he even felt excluded and he could only imagine how I felt. 

So this morning on Christmas I invited Steve to join (normally he’s with my mom and dad every year as he’s not married or in a relationship.) they know about him obviously but didn’t know about the switcheroo. That was when I revealed that last night “I” was Steve and expressed disappointment that nobody noticed and said this is why I stopped trying, nobody talks to me. 

My wife drew the line here, she was hoping we would keep this between the two of us as a funny prank. But how can I expect her family to see what jerks they’ve been if I don’t expose it? FWIW Steve was fine.",Everyone Sucks,efmpvl

**I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**

A while ago my daughter\[8f\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down.

"AITA for losing weight before my sister's wedding? I 28F used to be quite overweight, over the last year or so I have made many changes in my life and have successfully lost almost 100lbs. I don't live close to any of my family and don't post on social media so my family wasn't really aware of my weight loss. I did mention that I was making healthier choices but that's it. It's just that every time before that I've tried to lose weight it hasn't worked out so I didn't want anyone commenting on it.

My sister 26F got engaged last year and I'm super happy for her. Due to circumstances, the wedding had to be pushed back a little. It's happening a week from now and because I haven't seen everyone in so long I decided to come down two weeks earlier to help out and catch up. Well, when I came to see my family my sister freaked out upon seeing me. As it turns out she has gained a bit of weight not super noticeable to me she still looks great. But I think this is the first time in our lives that I'm smaller than her I've always been the ""fat sister"". She basically accused me of trying to upstage her and my parents are fully taking her side. I'm really not sure if I'm in the wrong here as so many of my family are taking her side of things.

"AITA for taking my daughter and leaving the wedding after her stepbrother pulled her wig? 


My daughter (16) Megan just finished her cancer treatment, she's lost her hair in the process and she's been incredibly insecure because of it. She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just ""harmless teasing"".


My husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.



We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing.

"AITA for not wanting coal for Christmas? This year I went to my fiancé’s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family’s house instead. 

I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fiancé “Dan” related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for “Dan’s” parents based off of things I’d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan’s other relatives (I didn’t know them that well). 

I wasn’t expecting many gifts from Dan’s relative’s because I didn’t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. 

At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. 

I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it’s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don’t have to stress over finding a gift, and it’s a fun experience for the newcomer as well.

"AITA for revealing to my dad’s wife the real reason why me and him were never close? My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. 

It hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me “killing” her and he can’t stand to look at my face. 

You can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That’s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. 

My aunt doesn’t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that’s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn’t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn’t matter because we’re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It’s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn’t know the real reason about why we’re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. 

But he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of “life stuff.” It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. 

I told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma’s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it’s been put in jeopardy. 

My dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn’t agree at all with what he did and it could’ve been avoided if I didn’t say anything.

"AITA for saying my sister needs to stop bringing up her miscarriage for attention? Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. 

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",Not the A-hole,eejyso
"AITA for not letting my girlfriend wear her “unique” dress to a wedding? UPDATED! 

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all!

"AITA for refusing to help my step sister with her house purchase and telling her and my step father that it's because of how they treated me as a child? I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",Not the A-hole,yzqvu1
"AITA for saying that my daughter inherits my house ""no matter what""? I'm a single mom in my 50s with one daughter. I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M. 

I have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter ""the house will be yours"" nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to?

One important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist.

My fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split. 

I spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her.",Not the A-hole,k9husr
"AITA for taking back my nephews Christmas present and giving it to my son. My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. 

My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.

Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.

I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. 

My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.

She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. 

Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.

My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.

My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.

Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.

"AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together? I (M27) am married to a man (M28). He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it’s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt &amp; uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt &amp; uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, &amp; invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt &amp; uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt &amp; uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, &amp; that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying &amp; ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

"AITA for being surly, rude and mean at a wedding and leaving early? I was asked to be a member of the wedding party. Despite this, I was THE ONLY person, not only in the wedding party, but also at the ceremony, who wasn't allowed to have a +1. This was an outdoor wedding with unlimited seating and these people don't give a shit about COVID so it wasn't about that.   


I was told it was because my relationship wasn't ""serious"" enough despite us being together for a year. That only engaged or married couples were invited. And that they didn't want ""some random guy"" in their wedding pictures who ""I might not even be with"" later in the future. They don't want to ""have to look at some random guy in their pictures"" even though he wouldn't have been in any of the posed pictures at all. Maybe just in the background of crowd shots.  


There have been NO conflicts between them and my boyfriend and he's a nice and mild-mannered guy who gets along with everyone so I don't think it was about him personally.   


I get to the ceremony and find out that literally everyone else has a +1, not just married couples, but there are couples there who have been dating for less time than me.   


This is when I started feeling surly. I smiled and played my part during the ceremony but inside I was very surly and angry.   


We then got to the reception which had way more people than the ceremony. This is where all the ""more distant friends"" were invited. AND EVERYONE THERE had a +1. I was literally placed at a table as the one single person and everyone else at the table was a couple. Some at the table were other members of the wedding party, but others were random distant acquaintances. People started asking me where my boyfriend was and I said I was told he wasn't invited. They asked why and I said I had no idea why. This is when I started letting my surliness show and started acting rude and mean, because I was humiliated.   


AND THEN, I was ""brought into conversation"" with the couple's male friend, Dean. I was previously told that Dean has a crush on me and I made it clear I wouldn't be interested even if I were single. Even after that he kept trying to message me and I ignored him. But now the people who ""brought me into conversation"" with Dean were like standing around staring at us and giggling behind their hands. Like they thought they were Cupid matchmakers. Dean was absolutely a participant in this  


I was meaner to Dean than I've ever been to anyone in my entire life. I was as fully rude as I've ever wanted to be when being the target of someone's romantic interest unwantedly. It's true I don't really know if I was being set up but I was already furious before that happened. Everyone was silent and awkward.  


I went back and finished my meal, and as soon as I was done, picked up my purse and left and went straight to my boyfriend's house, skipping most of the reception, cake cutting, speeches, and everything.

"AITA for telling my soon-to-be niece that she doesn't need to wear a dress to my wedding? I (32f) am getting married to my fianc´é (41m) next year. After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fiancé's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family).

Anyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fiancé's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, ""It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once."" and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset.

In response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the ""wedding colour"", to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable – and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.

My niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fiancé to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy.

"AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her ""You have to include everyone"" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson? My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say ""No"" to things she feels uncomfortable with.

There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. 

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

OP

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?

////

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",Not the A-hole,uaxvzp
"AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team? 
I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. 

Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. 

I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior.

"AITA for accidentally calling out a new colleague on lying about her language skills? Last week a new colleague ""Cathy"" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.

Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.

I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")

She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.

She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.

However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?

Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have ""witnesses"" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. 

Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an ""exotic"" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know ""exotic"" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. 

Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft ""g"" lol.) ",Not the A-hole,logumz
"AITA for serving my husband's family Mac N Cheese for dinner? My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep.


My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that 😉) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said ""NO"" because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's ""homemade"". I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is.

Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it ""appropriate"" to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they ""missed"" out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their ""traditional feasts"" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family.

I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese?

Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:

Her: ""So what does your husband do?""

Me: ""He works in finance.""

Her: ""Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??""

Me: ""Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary."" *Polite smile*

Her: ""Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??""

Me: *Awkward chuckle* ""I'd rather not say, but it's up there!""

Her: ""What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??""

Me: *Visibly annoyed* ""No, I just prefer not to say.""

Her: *Laughs in my face* ""You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!""

Me: ""You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.""

Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand ""salary talk"". I think she's old enough. Husband is fully on my side but said maybe I should fake apologize for the sake of office politics, which I somewhat agree with. But still, AITA?",Not the A-hole,15kcdv7
"AITA for ruining my brother's marriage because his wife left me at the pool [UPDATE IS HERE,](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaypoolproblem/comments/vznzde/update_aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_marriage/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) the mods wouldn't let me post because this post isn't old enough.

throwaway. this whole situation is so bizarre that I still can't really process it. it still doesn’t feel real but I feel scared and guilty

I (19F) had surgery a couple days ago to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out and because I have a really bad fear of dentists, they had to drug me pretty hard to do the removal. Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a ""responsible adult"" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.

Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.

I don’t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.

long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn’t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don’t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn’t go into detail about.

It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.

"AITA for sending my coworker into anaphylactic shock? I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.


So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.


Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.



Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) ""borrowed"" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. 


But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?




Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!



I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. 



My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?



To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.



I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.



Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.


And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.



Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)





Edit: the recipe




2 tbsp red curry paste 
3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp cider vinegar
3/4 cup of water
12 oz of coconut milk


I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo



I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new

"AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago? For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement “Never Have I Ever cheated before” came up.

Now’s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my “boyfriend” of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn’t drink, he went “hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex’s name*). You have to drink to that!”

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn’t haven’t any of it and ended things on the spot. I’m numb. I’m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words. I just can’t look at him right now. He ruined my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt. Am I being unreasonable?",Everyone Sucks,chb37s
"AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs? I have big boobs. I’m currently at 52kg and there’s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. 

My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. 

Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. 

Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?



**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.


**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).

I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)

My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.


**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:

- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.

- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.

- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.

- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.


**Update 2:**

The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. 

I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. 

I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.


**Last Update:**

I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. 

If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",Not the A-hole,giww2y
"WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding? My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I’ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. 

I’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. 

After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn’t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",Not the A-hole,btvqmi
"AITA for returning home after I found out that my husband booked 1st class for him and his friend while I got economy? 

My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled ""I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???"" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was ""royalty"" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I ""technically"" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

"AITA for telling my husband that I won't punish my daughter for speaking another language in the house because it upsets his son? This is a shitty situation but here we go. 

Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because ""oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone"". 

I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. 

Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. 

Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. 

A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. 

Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. 

Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. 

I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the ""She is my daughter, not yours"" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. 

Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. 

Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. 

Both of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?",Not the A-hole,if3rmj
"AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam? 

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.",Not the A-hole,vu7te5
"AITA for refusing to RSVP to my sister’s wedding because I’m required to write an “application essay” just to attend? Yeah I know this sounds insane but I’m living in it. 

So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.

Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half. As a result she’s sending out “re-invites” that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word “essays” to two questions. The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.

I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren’t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like ”why do you still want to celebrate this day with us?” And “what will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?” So she’s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. 

Anyways I told her in advance I’m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She’s said that to keep things fair if I don’t fill out the RSVP correctly I won’t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don’t show up I’m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. 

AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I’m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?

Edit: I’m 27F. I don’t live with family but she is my only sister.

Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as “surveys” but there’s a word limit requirement so if you don’t reach it on the google forms you can’t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend.",Not the A-hole,hzyy7b
"AITA for not forgiving my(27) fiance(28) for missing the birth of our daughter? My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only ""friend"" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\*\*\*\* and a c\*\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\*\*\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.

"AITA for reporting my classmates for joking that I have pretty privilege? Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

"AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train? Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

"AITA for calling the police on my client?  

I (28F) do babysitting on the weekends to make some babysitting on the weekends to make extra cash. There is one family I definitely should've fazed out by now but the kids are cute and if I don't have another job, it's easy money. My issue is, the mom is never home on time. She used to not give me return times but finally I started asking as it made it impossible to get anything done on the weekends. I'd go babysit so she could go to ""brunch"" but she'd be gone from 11 AM to 7 PM. My whole day was gone. After that, she'd start giving me times but never stick to them. She wouldn't even call to tell me, she'd just stay out.

On Saturday, I got to her house at 6 and she was supposed to be home by 9. I told her she needed to be on time because I had plans to go out with friends. I was even getting ready at their house after I put the kids to be. She promised. Of course, 9:00 rolls around and she's not home. I call her, no response. Text, no response. Another hour. Nothing. Still calling and texting. Finally, it is midnight. By this point, my plans are long ruined but I'm pissed and exhausted. I call her and leave a voicemail saying if she's not home in the next hour, I'm considering the kids abandoned and calling the cops. I also text her this. I try calling her 30 minutes later and it goes to voicemail on the second ring, I text her again and she leaves me on read. If she had reached out saying ""Hey, I'm staying out until x time"", I would've stayed. I don't know any of her family nor the father of the kids so I can't call them. I gave her a grace period of 15 minutes and tried calling again, finally called the cops (non-emergency line). They showed up and I showed our agreement in text from earlier in the week confirming that she'd be home by 9. They try contacting her, didn't answer. I was dismissed and they took the children to the police station. I go home and go to bed.

I am awoken at 3 AM by a frantic call. It's her. Where are the kids? Why am I not here? I tell her I followed through on my threat, check the police station. She cursed me out, I hung up and went to bed.

The next day, she sends me an essay saying the kids' father was called and there's a DCF investigation launched against her. She called me every name under the sun but I didn't think I was wrong until I spoke to a friend with kids. She said I should've just waited it out and refuse to ever sit for her again.

"AITA for canceling the plans for thanksgiving after my parents called my brother’s baby their “first grandchild”? [update](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayz_12345/comments/yy9a7e/update_on_canceling_the_plans_for_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

I (32f) have been with my wife Ava (34f) for 8 years now, but we’ve been married for 5. She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 &amp; 12) and a son (now 16). I’ve watched these kids grow up, I’ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they’ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.

My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fiancé Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there’s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn’t belong.
My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop— the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.

The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.
Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.

My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn’t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.

Sara spoke up and said “oh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.”

My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn’t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they’d say that my kids weren’t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn’t be their grandchildren because they weren’t really my children.

My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn’t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their “real” family while I spent the holiday with mine.

I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.

My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren’t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn’t want this to ruin my niece’s first thanksgiving.

I haven’t replied back. I meant what I said, but I’m worried that maybe I’m reacting too harshly.

ETA INFO:

I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents ""step grandchildren"". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.

Edit no.2:

- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.
- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.
- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",Not the A-hole,ysezdy
"AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama? I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",Not the A-hole,cyt2nl
"AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog? I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. 

While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.

So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". 

Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",Not the A-hole,ef49r2
"AITA for canceling the family trip because my stepson damaged my plants? 


I grow indoor plants and keep them around the house whether by the kitchen window or out on the front porch. I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting.

I have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house.

Later in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&amp;se.

"AITA for telling my daughter to cancel her marriage? I have a daughter(27) who was with her boyfriend for 7 years and they  got engaged not long ago(just a small party, not many guests). She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like ""I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children"".

Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. 

Well, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a ""healthy marriage"". But its my daughter's happiness that matters.

"AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him? I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. 

Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. 

I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. 

So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. 

Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. 

Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

"AITA for making a punny ""wall of shame"" for people who stole from my mom's garden? 
My mom is really into gardening and sometimes people have come by and stole potted plants, yard statuettes, and even dug whole plant bulbs with plants out of the ground. Or cut all the roses off her bushes because they were too cheap to buy from the florist I guess.

Anyway my dash cam of my car which I park in the driveway near the garden bed caught most all of them close up and as a way to help my mom not have her plants stolen I printed all their pictures out and made a poster that said 

""Oh Hay there! Don't be a Daffy-dil and steal, or else you might end up doing hard Thyme! We hope Thistle be a lesson to Yew! 

And I put the pictures of everyone stealing from the garden around the border. Also gave each person a funny fake name : ""mr potato head"" ""dill-a-tante"" ""pothead"" ""prick"" 'Succ-er"" "" i peony in my pants"" ""frond-less"" 'dirt-bag' 'in-fertile"" and ""root boy"" 

. I thought it was funny and cutesy, like how can you be offended with dumb plant puns... My mom thought it was hilarious and wanted me to hang it up because she was sick of seeing stuff stolen 

But I got a couple complains, one neighbor said I needed to take it down because I had a picture of his son a minor who did something dumb yes but was just trying to bring his sick girlfriend flowers. And that is was disproportionate and rude to publicly shame him.

I told him that it wasn't that big of a deal and he told me that I was being petty. I called his kid a little Birch which pissed him off and honestly might of been petty.

Another guy came to the house and returned a cutting his wife apparently tookbto propogate thinking it would be no big deal... But yeah it damaged the plant because she cut like a quarter off. And he asked if we'd take down the sign because she was on the board of directors or something from the town and whatever. My mom had answered the door and told him to make like a bee and buzz off.

"AITA for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents? I got married on Saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. 

So the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. 

My parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony.

"AITA for banning my MIL from the house? I M39 lost my late wife 6 years ago. I have a16 year old son 'Daniel' and I recently got engaged to my fiancee of 2 years.
Her mom and I aren't on good terms because of how she behaves. She's a controlling, self-centered, Dolly parton wanna be. I learn to ignore her crap but she's been annoying Daniel and criticizing his personality regularly (he's a private kid and still hasn't gotten used to the new family dynamic but he's in therapy and is doing fine) she keeps diagnosing him left and right calling him anti-social, autistic and other crap.

Fact is, Daniel is a shy, well manared kid but people confuse that with being ""anti-social"".
MIL tried several time to force Daniel to ""open up"" by embarrassing him with personal questions on family dinners and ""test"" his personality type.

I've realized the effect her behavior had on Daniel so I gave him the choice to no longer be in the same room/house as MIL and he appreciated this alot. MIL didn't like that Daniel kept his distance and no longer visits and kept bitching about how spoiled he will become for her daughter to deal with. I told her to stop bringing it up but she cried ""I'm just doing this for Daaannny;""


Last week she visited unexpectedly wanting to say hi to Daniel. After Daniel greeted her he went into the bathroom and she went into the livingroom with my fiancee.
I was in my bedroom when Daniel came and said his journal was gone. We looked for it but didn't find it. I asked my fiancee who was alone in the kitchen but didn't see it. I paused for a second to ask where MIL was, My fiancee said in the living room but I saw her coming down the stairs. I asked where she was, she said the bathroom. I saw her purse in hand so I bluntly asked if she took Daniel's journal. She looked offended and called for my fiancee when I insisted to see inside her purse. She wanted to leave but I didn't let her. Fiancee told me to stop it but I insisted and the journal was there. MIL tried to explain this was her only chance to get to know Daniel better because ""she cares about him"". I blew up at her and berated her for stealing from my son and told her she's banned from my house for the stunt she pulled. she argued with me then left.
My fiancee apologized for her but said banning her from the house was over the top.
It backlashed and and FIL argued and hoped his daughter realizes how f///ing ab///ve I am and call off the wedding for refusing to apologize to MIL. Fiancee said her family won't come to the wedding til I reconcile with her mom and cancel the ban but I won't let my son be disrespected in his own house and asked my fiancee to understand.

2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. 

3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said ""neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it."" She decided to leave. Again, I am being told I am childish. AITA?",Not the A-hole,uur9ho
"Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew? 
This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",Not the A-hole,jrrmdy
"AITA for laughing uncontrollably at my son when he asked me to replace a Christmas gift he broke out of anger? I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. 

My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. 

I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.

After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.

However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.

This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say ""but I need a chair!"" or ""What am I supposed to do now"" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.

He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",Not the A-hole,ei9igg
"AITA for not stopping my teenage sons gf from kissing him? My (50) son (17) recently got into a car accident with a drunk driver. I am very thankful that he is alive, obviously, but his car is totaled (the drunk driver was driving a pickup, and my son drives a small old convertible, most likely the reason for the amount of damage) and he is fairly injured, ie multiple breaks, lots of stitches, etc, and is currently recovering. This all occurred last week on saturday, the night of the accident.

My family (my wifr,45 and daughter,14) got there I want to say an hour before his girlfriend? When she came in she ran to him in his hospital bed and started hugging and kissing him (mainly lips but other places on his face too). She stayed for most of the night, checking up on him and being supportive, and I was happy that my son and his gf had such a good relationship. As we were driving home that night my wife said she was upset I didn't say anything to my sons gf. I asked why I would have as she was being a good partner

My wife said that it felt weird seeing that, especially Infront of his family. I said that he was going off to college regardless, and that she was being a really nice partner, and that night showed us how much she truly cared for him. She rushed off of work to get there and was still wearing her work clothes as she got there. My wife started getting angrier and said that she thought it was gross and that I should just ask her to leave sometime. I told her that I'm, not telling my hospitalized son that I'm taking away something that clearly makes him happy. She told me it was gross and that I needed to put a stop to it. I told her she was worrying about the wrong thing and that anything that brought our son comfort was good (my brother had taken my daughter home before this, she didn't hear us arguing). She told me I needed to step up and do my job and I've kept thinking about it, and I have started to keep thinking about it and thinking that I am in the wrong?",Not the A-hole,1l04t5i
"AITA for not disclosing that I am not Christian? To preface this, I do commissioned artwork, and don’t discriminate against any subject unless it’s racist, homophobic, otherwise hateful, or sexually disturbing…

I did a commissioned art piece with Christian iconography, a beautiful ornate cross, a saint, and scripture in calligraphy.
The client was happy with my work, paid me, and then…asked me what my favorite scripture was. I was honest and just said “oh I don’t really have one, because I’m not a Christian and wouldn’t really know which ones I’d like.”

He became upset and told me that he felt lied to, because I have posted artwork of Christian subjects before, and he assumed I would be Christian. He said the art doesn’t hold the same spiritual value, because it wasn’t made with “faithful intention”.

I was kind of unsure of what to say. I said “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I do artwork for everyone, and I am open to doing Christian artwork because it’s for the client, not me.”

Should I be disclosing if I don’t share a certain faith when commissioned to do artwork for it? AITA?

"AITA for not waking up a tourist who overslept and missed the day trip she paid for? Hi guys! I’m (21f) a Bulgarian tour guide who accompanies groups to Sicily. On a recent trip, one woman who was travelling alone (mid-30s) was consistently oversleeping. 

The first day after we arrived, we had a day trip to Etna and Taormina, for which we depart at at 8 am, as we do all other day tours. I make sure that all tourists are informed of the departure times on the bus the day before and they also have my number to call in case they forget so I can remind them. They also all have printed out pamphlets with the schedule made by the travel agency that I hand out that has the time for departure on it. 

All of the group was on time, except one woman. She was late by 10 minutes, which, okay, maybe she got caught up in something and was late. I excused it, then mentioned to the whole bus in the mic that I do not tolerate lateness beyond 15 minutes at most in case of emergency like a forgotten possession, and that I must ALWAYS be called and informed in case someone is running late. Trip went by okay otherwise. 

The next day this same tourist was late again, by TWENTY FIVE minutes. Almost an entire half hour. I called her twice to no answer and we were just about to leave without her when she came out running and got on the bus (she got lucky, as the receptionist of the hotel asked me about a missing piece of info on the rooming list and earned her some time). I reminded everyone AGAIN that I will not be waiting anymore for late tourists in the morning, and waking up on time is their responsibility. 

When we came back that evening, she asked me if I could 'make sure to wake her up on time'. I reminded her a THIRD time that I’m not responsible for waking people up. Everyone gets a printed itinerary with departure times, and I announce everything the day before. She kept saying, ""No, no, just knock on my door if I’m not out by 8:15"" and I kept repeating ""I really can’t do that for everyone, please set an alarm.""

Well, on the day we were visiting Syracuse, she didn’t show up. I waited 15 minutes after the supposed departure time, called her twice to no response, then left with the bus and the rest of the group. She called me in a panic about an hour later asking where we were. I explained the situation calmly. She got angry and said that I had one job and that I cheated her out of the money she paid to go on that day trip.

She missed the whole day trip and was furious the next day. Later she told the rest of the group that I abandoned her and also called my agency, leaving a bad review about me.

AITA for not personally waking up a grown woman despite warning her multiple times I wouldn't? 

EDIT: I talked to my manager today!! I was nervous at first because I was already tired of this whole shenanigan and didn't want to spend ages defending myself, so I went to him first and explained the situation before he approached me. He told me, word for word, ""Hun, I deleted that bs from my e-mail as soon as I read it"" LOL! An icon. They'll remove the bad review! ",Not the A-hole,1m84q9j
"AITA for refusing to change someone's baby's diaper? My wife and I have been married 10+ years and have a few kids.  

  
SIL and her husband had a baby 2 years ago.  No major complaints - they just tend to ask for people to do stuff that I would think they'd do themselves.  

* They'll come over our house (they live an hour away) and they'll ask ahead of time if we have their kid's favorite crackers on hand.  Why they don't just pack the crackers, I don't know (they are well off, money not an issue). 
* If one of them leaves the room, they'll ask one of us (my wife or kids) to be ""in charge"" of the baby - even if the other parent is right there, just scrolling on their phone or something.

 But whenever I say something to my wife, she says I'm being too much.

The other day, we're having a dinner at MIL's house when the baby had a poopy diaper.  SIL looks at me and say in the sweetest voice ""Uncle (my name), can you change the diaper?"" (she frequently does this when we're there but this was the first time I was asked)

I answered, politely, ""No, I'm sorry, I don't do that.""

""You....don't do diapers??""

""No, I don't do other people's kid's diapers if their mom or dad is around.  I mean if I'm babysitting, sure thing, but yea - if the parents are around - I just feel like its their job.""

SIL looks like she's ready to cry ""Well...I feel selfish.""

I smiled to try and set her at ease, ""Not trying to make you feel any way, just telling you a boundary is all.""

The table got really awkward as she got up and did the diaper.  Afterwards my wife blamed me for making SIL feel bad and said I could've just changed the diaper.  

Not trying to make anyone feel bad - but I've had 3 kids and I always took responsibility  -I watched them, I packed for them, and I changed them.  I'm not looking to be a secondary parent for this kid.

"AITA for telling my friend she’s in the same league as men she calls ugly? My friend [19f] downloaded dating apps like Tinder and Hinge for the first

I asked to see which people she was calling ugly and so she showed me her likes, and it mostly showed people perfectly in her league, as in moderately attractive guys. I told her that these guys were all in her league and she should give some of them a chance since she always complains about wanting to be in a relationship. 

She denied that she's the same league as them and said that she's much more attractive than them. I pointed out that in her own words, she doesn't match with any of the guys she does find attractive, so she's not in their league.

"AITAH for playing a voice recording to prove to my friend her daughter isn’t nonverbal? So I (30f) have a friend (34f) that has a “non-verbal” daughter (3f) let’s call her Allie. I watch her 4 days out of the week in my in-home daycare.

 **I require contracts for every child and she never filled out the special needs section. And at no point when she asked me to take Allie did she mention any type of speech delay or non speaking issue..** 

Although Allie didn’t speak much at first (I figured she was shy) she communicated her needs to me very well and said small things to me frequently. Last month I was in the bathroom (I keep the door BARELY cracked with a wedge so I can listen for any dangers and they can’t walk in on me or see me) she walked by and said “Ew you stinky”. I laughed and told her mom at pickup what she said and I was met with “SHE ISNT VERBAL WHY WOULD YOU MOCK HER” I reassured her that Allie has spoken to me quite a few times and I thought that it was a huge milestone from when she first arrived and was barely saying anything. She told me she didn’t believe me and that it was messed up that I would make up something like that to upset her. I told her that I wasn’t trying to upset her but I wasn’t lying either. I didn’t press the issue further. 

Here’s where I might be the AH. I decided to record Allie (a voice recording, not her face) telling me her name and what her favorite animal is. 

** I had full intention of showing mom the recording, but I was scared at first because of her blowup at me and I didn’t know how she would react. After a few short pickups and drop offs she told me it was water under the bridge and that she didn’t want to talk about it anymore. She even insisted that I went to the birthday party. After that I was just happy Allie could continue and I ended up forgetting I had the recording at all. 

Fast forward to Friday (about a month later) she had a birthday party for her other child. At the party I was socializing with other family members (Honestly I’m a total dumbass for forgetting that her family fully thought that she was nonverbal) I mentioned the funny things Allie has said to me while we were reading an animal book. Turns out the person I was talking to was her sister and she started yelling at me saying “SHE IS NON-VERBAL WHY ARE YOU LYING”. Both her and her sister start berating me saying that it’s f*cked up that I’m making this up about Allie being verbal. At this point I’m tired of being called a liar. I have two disabled children whom my son was non-verbal for many years. I wouldn’t lie about something like this. So while everybody was staring at me I was scared and felt backed into a corner. So I (remembering I had the recording) decided to prove my case and play the voice recording. Everybody was shocked and my friend told me to leave. I told her I didn’t want to cause issues but I’m not gonna be berated and called a liar. She said that I crossed the line recording her daughter and that I’m an a**hole for embarrassing her at the party. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I should have just let it go..

Edit for clarification and extra context: 

Whenever she would pickup and drop off she wouldn’t ask me much other than “how was her nap, how much did she eat” and I would hand her the daily report then she would leave and not stay for small talk even when I would try to initiate.  
I know people have busy lives so I’m not gonna try to make them stay and talk to me about their life story. 

I also didn’t do the recording to embarrass her in any way. I didn’t mean any vindication by it. I can admit I should have shown her immediately after I recorded it but I’m also human and I was afraid of a second blow up. Then after her saying it was water under the bridge I was just happy that she wasn’t gonna take Allie away so I put it in the back of my mind and forgot about it. 

I feel bad about how I went about my defense (hence the post). I know it was unprofessional and unethical. I apologized profusely to everybody at the party and the family as well. 

I will be putting cameras in my home that everybody will have access to as well as updating all the contracts to let parents know what is going to happen going forward. Peace of mind for everybody sounds good to me! Also, I will be making a call to cps about the situation and see what they have to say.

"AITA for being loud when my roommate has sex? I currently live in a student house with three other people.

The downstairs room is connected to the kitchen/dining area. The roommate who sleeps in this room asked for this specifically.

Recently, he’s been bringing his girlfriend around our house every single day. They’ve been dating a few years, but we’ve only just met her. 

They’re constantly in the kitchen and his bedroom with the door open, which makes it a bit awkward to be in there at times. They have sex SO loud. Going downstairs has become a nightmare because we constantly have to listen to the two going at it. They usually have sex in the middle of the day as well, the exact times people are going into the kitchen to make lunch and dinner. 

I’ve brought this up to him a few times and he said that we never gave him any rules when he asked if we could bring her around, but obviously we did not expect to be hearing them having sex constantly.

I asked him to play music and/or put the television on in the background while he was having sex and he refused and told us that he likes hearing his girlfriend while they are having sex so he won’t be doing that. 

To combat this, every time we go into the kitchen and we can hear them having sex, we’ve started playing music ourselves or putting on a TV show on loud to drown them out, which he’s said he is not very happy with and it ruins the mood for him. 

I don’t care about them having sex, I just don’t want to hear the bed banging, the moaning and the conversation that happens, it’s annoying and makes it uncomfortable to be in my own house. 

AITA? 

UPDATE: Hi everyone, sorry it’s been so long but I thought I’d give an update! It never changed. We tried blasting music, being loud, letting them know we were cooking, literally asking them: and they never stopped, but they have slowed down with time. 

We turned it into entertainment instead. We played stupid music (thank you for your suggestions!) and did karaoke in the kitchen. We did invite friends over, not with the intent that they listen because we didn’t want to put our friends through that, but if they did, we did make it a big deal.

It was plenty uncomfortable but it’s become a norm now, much to our disappointment. We are moving out in November and the roommate is moving back home to London, so we won’t have to deal with it much longer. 

We did walk into the kitchen last week and saw his girlfriend with a huge dildo attached to her, but good for them, I suppose. They learned to close the door eventually, because we just carried on cooking with headphones on.

"AITA for sending my little sister a vet bill after she tried to get my horses to breed? I (33F) am a Horse Breeder and own ten horses. I have a little sister (19F) who was a surprise baby for my parents, they didn't think they could have more after me so she is quite babied even now. They begged me to take her on to help her get some work and I agreed but made it clear she'd have to work hard and there would be no slacking. 

She has generally been *fine* with it and enjoys being around the horses though I do have to light a fire under her arse at times to get her to keep working. The problem however arose when a local animal rescue asked me to help them, they had a Stallion surrendered to them and they didn't have the capabilities to take care of him, I had room so agreed to take him. I've also arranged a full genetic testing on him to ensure he's alright as it seems like he was gotten through backyard breeders. I've also made an appointment to have him gelded as I don't know enough about him to risk him not being gelded. He has his own paddock and is kept in a separate stable than my own horses just to be safe. I'm slowly socialising him but i'm taking no risks.  

I've been letting my sister sit in on my breeding planning for 2025 and my main stars are going to be Dante and Willow. They've had four successful and healthy foals who are going to go into Dressage. I know they work well together and Willow has had a two year break so she'll be ready to go again this year. The first warning bell I overlooked was that my sister asked about the new Stallion and when i'd be breeding him. I explained he'd not be bred as there was too many unknowns, I don't know his health and I don't have a good enough grasp of his temperament. She protested that he was pretty though, prettier than Dante, and I explained there was more to this than looks. I thought she'd understood and didn't think further on this. 

Yesterday an emergency came up and I had to leave my sister alone for an hour. I told her to she could take an hour break. When I came back I found to my horror she'd put Willow into the Paddock with the new Stallion. I asked her what the fuck she was doing and she told me she just thought they'd work well together and she was doing me a favour.

One room for my parents
One room for my cousin and her husband
One room for my other cousin and his wife and one room for their kids are are both under 10. 

The last bedroom you may wonder.. is where my aunt made an innocent mistake in miscounting. There are only five bedrooms. They told me that my boyfriend and I will have to sleep on a pullout couch. 

I told my parents I would rather not sleep sleep on a couch even if it does pull out. I also don't want to make my boyfriend sleep on the couch with me either for his own privacy. It's in the living room which is in the middle of everything. I would rather not be woken to people starting their day and I would rather not have to change in the bathroom each and every time or even leave all my stuff in the living room as well. I don't want to change in my parents room either because I know I would probably rush so that they can have their own privacy. I don't want to put my luggage in anyone else's room and fill their room with my clutter. Same goes for my boyfriend, I don't want to make him do all that either. 

My family has never had this big of a vacation all together in such a long time. I would love to be involved and what not but I said I would rather not go if I can't have a room to myself OR I'll book my own place nearby and I WILL pay for my part for the main house everyone is in regardless. 

My mom refused both options as I will ""ruin"" the trip if I don't stay under the same roof. If I get my own place to stay it would SOLELY be to sleep. I plan to be with my family at all other times and events. I don't care about the price of only getting an Air BnB just to sleep. I want my privacy. 

Haven't mentioned it to my cousins or anyone else yet that I'm considering getting my own place as close as possible, though. 

AITA? 

EDIT: I think I'm adding this edit correctly, I hope this doesn't accidentally delete the whole post. The other day I responded to a bunch of comments the same thing pretty much but to my surprise got so much traction I did not expect so wanted to quickly update. Thank you for all your opinions and input!

I had booked the VRBO a bit ago. Have not brought it up yet. I don't know if I'm ready to open that yet or if I should wait till we all get there the first night and mention it when I'm headed two min down the road (got a very close VRBO) when I'm headed to bed

Lots of people brought up great points I never thought of so thank you as well

"AITA for making my sick husband clean up his vomit? Throwaway. My husband has been dealing with a stomach bug of some kind the last few days . Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, etc. I’ve been taking care of him and the house and kids by myself because of it which is a lot of work with 2 under 5. 


This morning my husband wanted to try eating something so I made him toast as requested. As he was on the couch nibbling on his breakfast I was making our toddlers their breakfast and feeding them when I hear him violently gagging in the other room. He’d been hanging out in the living room during this entire illness so he had a trash can there in case he had to puke or whatever. I called out to him to remember to use it or to go to the bathroom if he thought he was vomit. He didn’t listen and threw up all over the floor and got some on the couch. 


Husband then comes into where I’m feeding our kids and says he’s gonna go to our room so I can clean up his puke. I said absolutely not there was really no reason for him to vomit all over the floor so he needed to take care of it . I had been cleaning it up all weekend already without complaining when he was getting sick by surprise but he has plenty of time to prepare for this and not make a mess. Husband is now all mad at me for not showing him a good bedside manner.So AITA? 


Update: never expected so many comments. Feel very validated. All day my husband kept making snide comments at me about not being a good wife and anyone who cares about their loved one wouldn’t “punish” them when they’re sick. So I showed him your comments and it finally shut him up.


I’ve received many DMs and there’s been lots of comments about hubby possibly getting me and our children sick, don’t worry the rest of us are okay. Husband likely got food poisoning from eating food that had been sitting in his work break room for nearly 24 hours. 


Thanks for all the comments ",Not the A-hole,1k92qg7
"AITA, asked the neighbor to move their ‘little farm stand’ because people are stealing from MY garden **Before anyone says ‘just build a fence’ WE CAN’T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW. And no, no HOA.**

My neighbor set up one of those pantries/farm stands where people can take items that they grew in their garden, pantry stuff, donated stuff, etc. In theory it’s a great idea and especially in a time when life in America sucks ass and people are struggling to make ends meet (my family included)

The problem: people started coming into MY yard to pick things in MY garden. I’ve put up signs saying not to do it, I installed rabbit fence around the garden, I’ve angled a tarp so you can’t see what’s there from the road. People just hold their kids over the fence to pick tomatoes and beans or jump it.

I ended up getting into an argument with a lady over it. I yelled HEY, STOP. THOSE ARE NOT FOR YOU TO TAKE. She told her kid to move faster and then tried to run away. I caught up to her and asked her what the fuck her problem was and she turned it into how dare I swear in front of her child, why am I so angry, am I really that upset about a couple tomatoes. I said I am upset that you are STEALING from me.

The next day, I approached my neighbor. I asked if I could maybe help move it to the other side of their driveway so it’s next to the other neighbor’s house. They don’t have a garden out front. They said at least not until the end of the season. I asked if they could make larger signs, talk to people, just do SOMETHING..

They were like “can you really not afford to share?” I said that they aren’t taking my zucchini because they’re starving, they’re taking my tomatoes because they WANT them. They said that I’m going to have to learn to live with it for now and we can talk about a solution together that will benefit the whole community after. I said I do not care about a solution that benefits the whole community. I care about a solution that stops people from STEALING FROM ME.

So last night it happened again, man in his 50s. I sprayed his ass with the hose. He started yelling at me and after a minute or so the neighbor came out yelling at me too. People have posted on the neighborhood board to be careful if they come by because I’m an asshole. The neighbor says I’m scaring people away from a community resource. I told him that I’m going to continue until he does something about the fucking thieves who feel entitled to MY GARDEN.

I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind here. Am I the asshole for asking them to move it? Am I the asshole for being PISSED OFF that people are fucking STEALING from me? This is food for my family.

**First off, thanks for the responses. I got some good ones.** I'm happy that so many of you live in places where the cops would do anything about this, but this isn't the reality I'm living. Cops here would not give a shit if I sent them a video of someone picking from my garden. They would laugh in my face. Be thankful if you live in a place where the police are useful.

**It looks like signs are the best option for now.** Going to make signs indicating heavy use of pesticides and repeating that they are stealing food from the mouths of hungry children. I don't know why the signs we already have up aren't enough. Maybe more will help. I'm sure they won't.

**Will also scour Craigslist for free fencing** or similar items. Hopefully that pans out.",Not the A-hole,1lqunle
"AITA for not going to my TWIN'S Wedding??? I (24M) have an identical twin. We're not close, but I thought we had basic mutual respect. That belief was tested.

I grew up in a traditional Southern town &amp; only began coming out in college, about five years ago. It's been slow, especially with family. But since moving to DC in '23 for school/work, I've felt more comfortable living authentically.

After moving, I met my boyfriend (26M), &amp; we've been together 2yrs. Over time, I've introduced him to friends and family when I felt safe.

Cut to Nov. '24: I was home for the holidays &amp; told my twin &amp; his fianceé about my bf. They seemed happy for me. While staying with them, wedding details arose, &amp; they asked if I'd be bringing a date. I said yes, my bf. My twin had gone to bed, but his fianceé said, ""While there are pros and cons, it's up to you if you want to bring him."" That felt like a green light. My twin constantly deferred to her on decisions, so I didn't think I needed to double-check.

5 months passed, my bf &amp; I had spent $1,300 on travel (flights, hotel, etc.). 3 weeks before the wedding, I mentioned on a call with my brother that we were all set. His tone shifted: ""Oh, is BF actually coming?""

I reminded him of the convo with his fianceé. He said she never gave me permission &amp; accused me of making it up. Then said, ""We can't allow your bf to come. We worry how Dad's side will react.""

I offered to call Dad on the spot. He dodged, saying he'd check with his fianceé (despite just saying it was his decision.) An hour later, no change. I was still invited-ALONE, still expected to buy a groomsman-match suiting (even though I wasn't in the party), &amp; show up smiling.

That's when I snapped. I asked, ""If I didn't invite your fianceé to my wedding, would you still come?"" He couldn't answer &amp; ended the call after some harsh words. 

Trying to make things right, I came out to my dad (which I feared for years) to explain the situation. He was surprisingly indifferent &amp; even said uninviting my bf was extreme. He offered to talk to extended family. I thought I was removing the main obstacle. 

Weeks later, my twin called again. He now claimed our friends would be ""weirded out"" (So the excuse shifted) I said, ""If my bf's not invited, I'm not coming."" He didn't budge.

Here's the kicker: days later, my dad told me the fianceé admitted she did give me permission but changed her mind when she remembered ""who would be there."" She denied this to my twin. Also, one of her bridesmaids is openly gay and brought her gf, but, according to the fianceé, ""she's not part of the family,"" so it's different.

So I didn't go. I'm still wondering if I made the wrong call. My absence was noticed. I got texts asking where I was. My mom had to explain it repeatedly. So instead of avoiding attention, my absence became the story. My relationship with my twin is dead, &amp; some family ties now feel fragile.

Part of me wonders, should I have sucked it up &amp; gone solo, just to preserve bonds that shaped my early life?

So, AITA for skipping the wedding?",Not the A-hole,1lynnsd
"AITA for refusing to give up my front-row spot at a concert to someone claiming to be disabled? A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to another country to see an artist I’ve been a fan of for six years. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and I’d been waiting months for it. I sacrificed a lot financially and mentally to make it happen. Since it was my first (and probably only) time seeing them, I went all out: I bought GA tickets and arrived at the queue at **5 a.m.** (even though the doors wouldn’t open until 6:30–7 p.m.) in freezing cold weather. I waited all day—hungry, cold, and dehydrated—but it was worth it because when the doors opened, I secured a **front-row barricade spot**, right up against the stage. This was my dream spot.

Then, a guy behind me tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was disabled. He said the venue was supposed to let disabled attendees in early, but they hadn’t. He asked me to give him my spot at the barricade. Here’s the thing: I know this venue is **very accommodating for disabled attendees**. I actually have friends with disabilities who’ve gone to shows here, and the staff always ensures they get to the front row safely during a designated time frame before it gets too crowded. 

Now, I’m a **very short person (155 cm/5’1”)**, and this guy was **extremely tall**—easily over 5.5 If I gave him my spot, I wouldn’t be able to see anything at all because he would completely block my view. I honestly would’ve been willing to move if he wasn’t so tall or if I could still see from the second row. However, in this case, I knew I’d lose the view I had waited more than 10 hours for.

I tried to compromise. I pointed out that the **right side of the barricade** was still open and suggested he go there. Since he’s so tall, he’d still have a great view and could hold onto the rail for support. However, he refused, saying the view wasn’t as good as where I was. While we were talking, that section filled up, and he became more insistent. He said he’d ""have a hard time"" if he couldn’t take my spot.

At this point, I got frustrated and explained:

1. If his disability was that serious, he should be in the **accessible section**, which is specifically designed for attendees with disabilities.
2. If he insisted on being in the standing section, he should’ve brought a support aid, like a cane (I’d seen someone nearby with one).
3. If he spoke to security, they could escort him to the **front-row disabled seating**, which has a fantastic view and is much more accommodating.

After hearing this, he called me an ""asshole,"" told me to ""get fucked,"" and left.

I feel like he just wanted my spot and wasn’t being truthful. The venue offers several options for disabled attendees, and I tried to direct him to alternatives. I feel bad for saying no but I don’t think it was fair for him to ask me to sacrifice my entire experience.

So, **AITA** ?

EDIT: Regarding the man’s height, after everyone pointed it out I've realized I indeed made a mistake. I don’t live in a country that uses the metric system and I should’ve double-checked my conversion instead of estimating from memory. I meant to say he was over 170 cm, probably around 175-180.",Not the A-hole,1hlcdzb
"AITA for not wanting our friend to ever come back to our house after he ate literally everything we owned? My husband and I live abroad. Earlier this year, a mutual acquaintance (let’s call him “K”) reached out saying he’d been scammed with an apartment rental and had nowhere to stay. At first, we only offered a weekend, but he was polite, helped around the house, and seemed grateful, so we ended up letting him stay the full 20 days he’d asked for.

During that time, some things rubbed us the wrong way. He never bought groceries, and multiple times he pretended he was going to pay but “forgot his wallet” or claimed he could only use Apple Pay (not accepted at our local supermarket). He’d eat way more than his share (once my husband and I shared half a pizza and he ate the other pizza and a half without contributing). Still, we felt bad for him, so we let it go.

We stayed friendly, and a few months later we were planning a 17-day trip. Since he was struggling with rent, we offered him to stay at our place in exchange for taking care of our dog. I even wrote a Google Doc with instructions for the house, dog care, gym access, etc. I told him he could eat anything that was going to expire (fruit, veggies, yogurt, etc.).

When we came back… EVERYTHING was gone. And I mean everything. The entire fridge, freezer, pantry. He finished two jars of jam, a jar of peanut butter, a giant Costco bottle of olive oil, condiments, rice, snacks, cheese, even my husband’s supplements (creatine, protein, collagen). He completely destroyed a ceramic pan. He consumed things that usually last us six months in just 2 weeks. I honestly suspect he might have taken stuff with him because it’s insane how much was missing.

I didn’t confront him except to ask him to replace the pan, which he mocked me about (“it’s just a pan, why are you making it a big deal?”). I felt deeply disrespected. Now he keeps texting me, acting like nothing happened, and wants to hang out. I told my husband I don’t want him in our home ever again. My husband says I’m being too harsh, and if he wants to stay friends, that’s his choice, but I feel completely taken advantage of and disrespected.

"AITA for refusing to punish my daughter after she blew up on the classclown that she dint want at her birthday party? My daughter is 13 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.

My daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was ""she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday."" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.

My ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.

It was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, "" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything."" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.

Kelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all.

"AITA for telling my BIL he needs to book a hotel when he and my sister were staying at my house? My sister and her husband live across the country and decided they wanted to come visit. I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom and I set up a bed in my home office because they wanted to stay at my house. They had been here for 4 days. 

The bathroom has been a big problem. He spends hours in there. After the first day, I talked to my sister about it. She says he has a condition where he needs the bathroom a lot. So I let it rest. On day 3, it was even worse. There was a time where I had to excuse myself to go to the store so I could use the bathroom twice because he wouldn’t leave. 

The last day i woke up at 4am and had to use the bathroom very badly. I knocked on the door and he said he’d be out in a minute. I told him I really had to go. It took him an hour to get out. The nearby store wasn’t open at that time and I had to do something I am not happy I had to do because I couldn’t wait. 

The next morning I told him he needs to get a hotel. I can’t be blocked from using the bathroom in my own home because he takes it hostage. I get he has a condition, but so do I. And I make sure I have my own bathroom when I travel so I don’t get in the way of other people needing the bathroom. 

My sister and her BIL were very upset and called me ableist. I told them what I had to do last night because he was in the bathroom for so long and they said I could’ve held it. I told them they need to leave and find a hotel or stay with other family, he just can’t stay here anymore.

"AITA for putting my hand over my SIL’s camera at my own birthday dinner after I told her no filming? I (29F) had a small bd dinner last weekend with my husband (31M), SIL “Lina” (27F), MIL and two friends at a normal but nice place. Lina’s an 'influencer"". She films literally everything - plates, forks, ppl breathing.

Three days before, I wrote in the family chat - please don’t film me. Food, room is fine, just not my face. She said “got u”.

We sit down and within like 10 mins her phone is up. I say quiet, “pls don’t point it at me.” She goes, “you look great, it’s just vibes.” Husband backs me, “she said no.” Lina rolls her eyes, lowers it… for maybe 2 minutes.

Then the cake comes (little sparkler, staff singing). Lina stands and points the camera right in my face like, “birthday girl reveal!” I put my hand over the lens and said, “stop” I didn’t grab the phone or touch her, just covered the camera for a second. She snaps that I “ruined her shot” and this is her job. MIL says to “let it go for one night.” I said that it’s my night - actually.

It got awkward fast. Server was right there, I felt embarassed. Husband tried to change the subject, but Lina kept muttering about how she had to scrap “everything.” I even paid for my own dessert (long story) and we left pretty quick.

Next morning Lina texts that I “humiliated” her and made her look unprofessional in front of everyone. MIL says I should’ve moved seats if I didn’t want to be in frame. Husband says my boundary is fair but maybe I “made a scene” by doing it during the song when eyes were already on me.

She’s posted me before without asking and co-workers mentioned it. I’ve asked her to blur/remove and it turns into drama, which is why I set the boundary in writing before dinner.

"AITA for “kicking a pregnant woman out of her seat” Ok so this happened a few hours ago and I’ve only just calmed down, because I hate conflict. 

Basically I was doing a long travel day( 5 ish hours) so I booked my train in advance to ensure that I had a reserved seat. When I get on the train a woman is in my seat, so I politely inform her that I think that’s my seat show her my ticket and ask her to move. She checks her ticket and just says well I must have sit in the wrong seat and puts her head down. I say that it’s my seat and could I please sit in it. At this point her partner sitting opposite her starts speaking at me in what I perceive to be an aggressive tone. He suggests I find another seat( which there are none because it’s busy) and I say but I booked that seat and there are no other available seats in the carriage . He then raises his voice and says well someone else is in our seats and that his missus is pregnant. I say I understand and that I have a heart defect( which I do) and said everyone has their own medical issues and reasons standing for long periods of time might be difficult. And here I could be the asshole , I ask him to not speak to me in an aggressive tone , and that I will make a complaint.  He then starts swearing at me and I ask him to stop. Eventually the woman gets up and allows me to sit there and he continues to berate me saying he hopes I feel good for myself and that I’m quiet now I have my seat, when really I just stopped engaging as I felt there was no point. 

One of the men who was sat beside him offers that him and his partners sit in the seats opposite me ( it’s a table seat) at which point he sits his partner down and then laughs at me and points in my face. Eventually when the ticket inspector comes around they are asked to movr to their assigned seats and she asks if I’m ok as another passenger had made a complaint on my behalf.
Even so was I the asshole ? Should I have just left them alone as she was pregnant? And did I in any way escalate the situation ?

I’ve learnt a lot about myself and my ability to let anxiety and over thinking get in the way of trusting my decisions. I honestly came into writing this thinking that I escalated the situation, so to have people affirm that it’s just standing my ground and that that is alright has been really gratifying. It has taught me however I have a way to go with standing up for myself, and not being such a people pleaser.

"AITA for leaving a family gathering and taking the cake with me after getting my feelings hurt? I (27F) hit one year sober (from alcohol) at the beginning of the year. This was a huge accomplishment for me. It was bigger to me than finishing college. I told my family that next time we were together for family dinner I had something to celebrate. This all happened at my mom’s. The kids were playing and the adults were hanging out. I took the moment to share that I’d reached 1 year sober and how good I felt about it. 

They went with “Ohh, that’s what you were talking about” and “Has it been a year already?”

I am embarrassed to admit I hoped someone would say they’re proud of me.

My BIL Steve looked at my sister and they both said “Well…” at the same time and she said “Since we’re all here, (Niece) just got into (a specific gymnastics thing). It’s been a LONG road but she did it!”

Steve popped some wine they'd brought and started giving everyone glasses/cups. He made eye contact with me and his face fell. I had this gnawing feeling so got up from the table. I took a walk.

I tried to get through the moment mentally so I could be present for my niece to celebrate her success. But when I got back to the house my sister asked me why I left without saying anything. I said I needed a minute to myself.

She looked at me funny and said “Okayyyy…”

I said I’d shared something I was very proud of and she bulldozed over it. My mom put her hand up and asked me what my news was. I said that I’d told them. I hit one year sober. Mom said my generation always wanted praise for doing the bare minimum, that wasn’t an accomplishment it was just what I needed to do, like graduating high school.

I tried to make it through to dinner but found myself just not in the mood anymore. I decided to go home. 

**Here is the direct thing I am being called a butthead for:** Id brought a small berry chantilly cake (my favorite) to share after dinner. It was the thing I decided I earned. The kids had definitely seen it. On my way out I decided to take it home with me. 

I guess when they realized the cake wasn’t in the garage fridge anymore, my sister called to ask me why I took it. I said I did because it was MY cake to celebrate MY accomplishment.

She said, word for word “Are you fucking serious? Oh my god Emma, GROW UP. You are such a fucking baby.”

My Mom later texted me directly to tell me how disappointed she was that I threw a tantrum because my niece got more attention than me. I don’t think her read of what happened is right, but that is why I am asking you guys. Am I the asshole because I took home the cake in the end? Was that really childish of me, considering the kids saw it and then didn’t get any?

As I was putting on my shoes to leave, Steve found me and directly apologized and said that he was completely oblivious in the moment. I know he did not do anything to intentionally hurt me.

**EDIT FOLLOW UP:** Hi everyone, I just wanted to follow up and say thank you to everyone for the responses. I have a lot to think about when I next go to therapy (today, actually) and work on. I do want to clear up a few things that I've seen come up a lot on the comments:

I am not in AA. I'd tried AA before and it was not compatible for me. It works for a lot of people very well and I'm happy for you if it works for you. So, stuff about ""the steps"" and ""personal inventory"" are not relevant to me.

It wasn't a party for my niece, it was just a family dinner. The cake \*was mine\* and wasn't brought \*for\* my niece. I didn't take it \*because\* I wanted to ""get back"" at them. I took it because it's my favorite cake and I wanted to eat it because it was my thing that I earned. 

 I don't know why they opened wine for my niece getting into the gymnastic program. But I also don't think it's my place to say anyone else has a drinking problem, and I'd prefer to have eyes on my own paper. :)",Not the A-hole,1i8cj5t

"AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress? I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered.

Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for. My husband thinks I am being too harsh, as I wasn't explicit on whether I was lending or giving her the dress. Amy has gone to live with her mom since and thinks I am being unfair. I am not sure if I have taken it too far and if I should stand my ground.

Edit: I have got a disturbing amount of PMs asking me if I called the police and comments literally bullying a kid who made a mistake... I hope most of the commenters never become/are stepparents. I just wanted to answer a few questions after this post got some attention:

The dress sold for £150 recently, which isn't a lot, but it had more sentimental value for me. Amy used the money to partly pay for new AirPods. I spoke to my husband again, who apologised for being more neutral earlier and thinks my grounding was justified. I also told Amy's mom, who got my dress back from the person Amy sold it to and agreed with me to ground Amy and apologised on her behalf. I DID NOT call the police or sue my stepdaughter, Amy has since apologised, and we have made up. Kids make mistakes sometimes, like you did at their age, and I was definitely more upset when I made the post than I am now.",Not the A-hole,1klzbca
"AITA for not cooking breakfast for my niece and nephew? My (36, M) sister (34, F) moved into my house about 2 months ago with her 2 kids (7M, 4F) after she ended a really bad relationship

I’ve always been an early-ish riser and like to get up and make myself some breakfast around 7 or 8am. Nothing spectacular, just whatever I felt like that day

When my sister moved in, I realized quickly that she liked to sleep in. Some days she was up as late as 1pm…I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I knew how hard her break up was for her 


Since my sister slept so late daily, she wouldn’t get up and take care of her kids. I got into a routine with my niece and nephew that basically whatever I cooked myself for breakfast, I’d make enough for them as well until the other morning 

I woke up and had an urge to make huevos rancheros. The kids immediately started complaining that they didn’t want that and wanted something different

I was nice and ended up making them pancakes since it’s not their fault that their mom is really struggling 

The next morning, I was making breakfast potatoes and eggs but all I heard was “we don’t want that. We want something different” so again, I obliged…finally after 3 mornings of my unwanted food critics getting a separate meal, I finally told them “I’m no longer cooking 2 different meals for breakfast. If you don’t like what I’m making, go ask your mom to get up and do it”

So, they went upstairs to wake her up, but she still didn’t come downstairs until after 1pm. The kids immediately started complaining that I “refused to feed them” and my sister was PISSED

She started in about how they need to be fed by a certain time and a bunch of other things that she said to try and intentionally hurt me

I snapped and told her “look I know you’re depressed, but wake up and take care of your fu**ing kids instead of expecting me to do it”

She got quiet after that and is still giving me the cold shoulder, but I know she’s expecting me to apologize.

Sorry this was long winded, but let me have it. AITA?

"AITA for yelling at my friends and leaving dinner after they all made fun of me and gave me a gay intervention? I (21F) went out to dinner with 5 friends, 1 guy, 4 girls. For context, I look very masculine (short hair, deep voice, no makeup, masculine style, etc.), sometimes I get mistaken for a man. Usually if it's by someone I'm never gonna see again i.e. cashier/waiter I don't really care to correct them.

My friends and I were having dinner at a nice fancy place and the waiter came to our table and he mistook me for a man. One of my friends responds ""Oh, she's not a man, she's just a lesbian"". Everyone laughs and the waiter apologized. After he left, I asked my friend ""why did you say that?"". I have never said or indicated in any way that I'm a lesbian, because I'm not. I've never had a boyfriend, but that's because I'm not interested in a romantic relationship, but we have talked about male celebrities we find attractive. I thought it was clear I was straight.

My friend rolled her eyes at my question and said ""Oh c'mon, we all know you're a lesbian"". I was shocked. More friends jumped in and said ""yeah, you don't have to lie to us"". I wasn't lying. They started making jokes about me ""dressing like a lesbian"", ""hiding my sexuality"", ""being in a glass closet"", ""everyone knows"", ""it's 2025 no one cares"", etc. It all seemed like it wasn't a joke and they actually believed it. One of my friends Eva even joked ""you were obviously in love with Ines"". I showed genuine shock at this remark and she reassured me ""It's okay, we all don't mind if you're gay"".

Ines was an on/off childhood friend of mine and our friendship ended badly a few months ago, I was very upset by it and confided in my friends. I never thought they would use it against me.

I told them firmly that I'm not a lesbian, this isn't funny and I was not in love with Ines. Once they saw I was being serious about this, their tone and attitude became less jokey. They started lecturing me on self-acceptance, being in denial, internalized homophobia (I'm not homophobic), heteronormativity, compulsory heterosexuality, etc. It was like some sort of gay intervention. I found it absolutely ridiculous.

I yelled at them for being bad friends because I couldn't even dress how I want or talk to them about my troubles and I left the restaurant.

It's the morning after and I have serious regret, I don't know what to say to them and what to do.

"AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood. ",Not the A-hole,1jzb2tl
"AITA for not answering the door when my ex’s mom showed up at my apartment unannounced? This happened a couple of years ago but I was talking about crazy MIL stories with a friend and she thinks I was an AH.

I have sole custody of my children. My ex and his family live about a 9 hour drive from me. One day at around 9am there was knocking on my bedroom window. I peeked through the bottom of the blinds and just see woman’s sneakers. So I peek higher and make eye contact with my ex’s mom. All I can think is WTF?

The apartments where I live are not gated so anybody can drive onto the property, just not go in buildings without a key. Which means, ex’s mom couldn’t knock on my door because she couldn’t enter my building. Anyway, now that she’s seen me I change and go see why she’s there. Only reason why she has my address is because a few months back she asked to mail some stuff for the kids &amp; I dumbly gave her my address. She tells me she was in the neighborhood. I asked her why she didn’t call me before arriving and she said it was a “last minute decision”. I let her in and she sees the kids for a bit. When she leaves I tell her next time she needs to give me a heads up before arriving, and I’m not talking 10 minutes before, I need at least a 1 week notice.

So, this is where I might be the AH. About 4 months later she pulls this stunt AGAIN. When I hear the tapping on my window. I know exactly who it is. I don’t bother looking out the window. She starts calling me. After the 5^(th) call, I answer. She tells me to open up because she wants to see the kids. I’m like what? I’m not even home- why she didn’t tell me she was coming? I’m 45 minutes away visiting my dad with the kids. She demands dad’s address - I refuse to give it to her. I tell her I have no idea when I will be home. Yes, complete lie. Anyway, she doesn’t believe me, she thinks I’m home, again says it was a last minute decision. I hang up on her, I’m getting texts from ex demanding I let his mom see the kids. I tell him what I told her -I’m not home.

Imagine my surprise when I hear the police banging on my door a few minutes later! I don’t answer. I get a call from a random number - the police officer. He is there to perform a wellness check because ex’s mom hasn’t heard from me in 3 days and she’s extremely worried. Also, according to him, it is illegal not to answer the door when a police officer knocks. I tell him she is lying- I just spoke to her on the phone, she showed up unannounced. I made it clear to her not to do that, and I am out with family and I don’t need to come back just because she showed up unannounced, she is ex’s mom and I don’t have to talk to her.  After that phone call I get a text from ex calling me an AH and how hard would it have been to let his mom see the kids when she drove all the way there just to see them.

I want to make it clear – I don’t mind her visiting, I don’t mind her being around my kids – but I cant stand her showing up unannounced and demanding to see my kids like that. It was like she was on a weird power trip.",Not the A-hole,1nobfes
"AITA for laughing at my stepson and ruining his wedding? Throw away, shortened for character count. 

For context, I have been married to my husband for just over 20 years. We started dating when my stepkids were 5 and 3. Our kids are: Adam (28, stepkid #1), Ben (26, stepkid #2), Charles (20), David (17), and Ellie (13). 

Adam is getting married at the end of summer to his fiancé Alice (27). We have all been very excited for them. All of the kids have roles for the wedding, Charles is the best man, the other two boys are groomsman, and Ellie is a jr bridesmaid. 

Last weekend we had a dinner for my husband’s birthday, all of the kids attended along with Alice. The topic of the wedding came up again, and this is where it started to go downhill. Ellie brought up that she was SO excited to go dress shopping and that we planned to go to a bigger city in a few weeks to get her a dress and me a stepmom of the groom dress. 

At that, Alice looked at Adam sideways and responded that we only needed to worry about one dress, Ellie’s. Ellie kind of laugh and said “what are you expecting mom to wear? A suit?”. Alice responded with “(My name) isn’t going. You know we are keeping our guest list very limited to only family and a few close friends.” WHAT. Adam and Alice have been to our house numerous times for holidays, dinners, just to say hi since they’ve been engaged, this has never been brought up. 

Pretty quickly things escalated. The cliff notes version is that Charles asked them to clarify if they were choosing to uninvite me now or if I was never invited. Alice confirmed the latter. why? Adam said it’s because I’m not his mom. Charles, David, and Ellie argued with Adam and Alice that none of them were going to go if I wasn’t invited. That it was cruel to leave me out given I’ve been his parent for a majority of his life and loved him like my own. My husband and I admittedly sat there for a minute just fucking shocked. 

Adam finally turned to my husband and said, “well?” My husband told him he wouldn’t be going either. Adam then turned to me and asked if I was really going to let everyone ruin his wedding on my behalf. Here’s where I might be the asshole: I just laughed. Idk what came over me but the entire thing was just so ridiculous that laughing was the only thing I could get out. I told my husband I’d be waiting in the car and left. And then promptly bawled my eyes out.

Anyways, Charles, David and Ellie are not talking to Adam. Adam called my husband yesterday to try and smooth things over. He was still adamant I’m not invited and it’s their wedding. He also requested I apologize for laughing at him. My husband told him tough shit. It’s their wedding and they can invite whoever they want, but they cant control who will actually go. He said THEY owe ME an apology and that Adam should be ashamed of himself. 

I’m getting texts now asking wtf I did and why I’m being a “stepmonster and ruining the wedding” AITA?

"AITA for dropping my kids off with my wife when she is with a grieving friend My wife’s best friend (Jessie) lost her husband about a month ago. My wife has been at her home almost every single day since.  My job has me being on call some nights and money is tight so I can’t not be on call.



I know Jessie is struggling but it is stressing me out a ton to be a basically a single parent  since my wife is never home. I have talked to her about cutting back but that ends in an argument about me being heartless.



Yesterday I was on call and I actually got called in. I couldn’t leave our two daughters home alone ( 6 &amp; 9) so I called my wife telling her she needs to head home now, I need to leave.  She told me no, and to figure it out. 



We don’t have the money for a sitter,  my parents  live too far away, her parent aren’t allowed near the kids ( they suck) and my friends have their own lives/families.



So I packed up the kids and one my way to work dropped them off at Jessie’s house. My wife was pissed that I did that.



When I got back we got into a huge argument and I told her that she actually needs to be a parent. That I am very sick of her playing house at Jessie’s house and we have our own kids.

"AITA for refusing to leave my apartment for a day because of my muslim roommate’s conservative mom? Throwaway bc my roommates know my main account. So, I (23M) live in a college apartment with 2 roommates, both of which are women, and one of them is Muslim (let's call her sana). We all get along pretty well and have lived together for over a year with no issues. 

Yesterday, Sana told us her mom was visiting for the upcoming weekend. For info, her mom is very conservative and religious, and apparently doesn’t approve of her daughter living with male roommates (Awkward because I exist). As a result, Sana asked if I could leave the apartment entirely for the day her mom was visiting. Like, be out the whole day and even find somewhere else to sleep overnight.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that bc I had a major assignment due, and I focus best when I’m working from home. I also didn’t wanna have to pack up all my stuff and go stay somewhere else just to keep up an appearance for someone I don’t even know. Additionally, I pay equal rent and felt like I had a right to be in the apartment.

Still, to try and compromise, I offered to stay in my room the entire day and be quiet/ not come out at all on the condition that I’d at least be allowed to quickly come out to make lunch or dinner, or they could just bring food to my room so I wouldn’t starve. I genuinely thought that was fair and respectful.

But no, sana wasn’t happy with that and insisted I should be out of the apartment entirely. She said her mom would “freak out” if she found out a guy lived there and it would cause a lot of drama in her family. I said while I understood her position, I wasn't going to dip from my own home, especially with a big deadline hanging over me.

She's still pissed and being pretty cold toward me now and also vented to our other roommate, who stayed neutral and said she saw both sides.

I really wasn’t trying to be difficult or disrespectful. I understand her cultural situation, but I also feel like it’s unfair to expect someone to completely vacate their home just to accommodate someone else’s family’s beliefs especially when I tried to find a middle ground.

So, AITA? 

Edit: Sana never chose to have male roommates, but it just so happened that she was practically bullied out of her old apartment (all female) for a conflict involving another girl and this was her last resort. Also, I'm so disheartened to see so much hate in the comments and it's enlightened me to be kinder and more understanding to sana and her situation. This was never meant to start a debate in the comments and I urge everyone to have more empathy and humanity. 

I will also be going home and asking a friend if I can stay over for a day. For everyone concerned about how if I let it by pass now, that it will happen again and again, I will speak to sana about this properly and urge her to talk to her mom. Thank you for all the level headed and empathetic comments I did get that helped me understand her perspective better, as I do care for her greatly and never want to hurt her if I can help it. One day isn't the end of the world and if it helps her, I've realised Id be happy to do it ",Not the A-hole,1n7ciex

I was stunned. No one laughed, no one corrected her. My boyfriend just kind of chuckled awkwardly and changed the subject. I sat there in silence for another 20 minutes before excusing myself and leaving. I took an Uber home.

She’s been oddly competitive, commenting on my body, comparing our rings, like  we are in a competition, saying things like “this day is as much about me as it is about you.”

  

I honestly thought  she was joking until she showed me the dress she bought,   a white, floor length gown that looks exactly like a bridal dress. And I I told her, flat out, she cannot wear that because in my opinion it doesn’t match the occasion . She got quiet, then burst into tears, saying it’s her “and this was an opportunity to feel beautiful before getting old” and that I’m selfish for not letting her have this one thing.

I felt really bad about this so I also offered to go shopping with her to find something elegant and more appropriate. 

And all of a sudden her countenance changed and then She told me I was controlling and ungrateful. What gave me peace was that My fiancé backed me up, as did my maid of honor. Now my mom is threatening not to come to the wedding, and my aunt says I should just “let her have this” to avoid drama.

"AITA for not giving the “dollhouse” I built to my niece, but to my wife as a gift? (It’s NOT a dollhouse, but I didn’t want anyone to think I was being misleading on purpose by saying I built a house)

I (28M) made my wife (28f) a replica of a house that’s known to fans of a musician, but wouldn’t mean much to others. It’s about 2 feet tall and wasn’t very complicated to build, but my wife had said a few times over last year that she thought it would be cool to have for little trinkets. She’s like a crow with her trinkets, I love it. She didn’t know I was making it for her, but I did sneakily involve her in its creation through having her make a couple Tiktoks when we were out together so I could get the colors right. She has no idea, lol. 

I was excited, so I showed a picture to my brother. He told me it was cool, but didn’t get the purpose. He showed it to my niece Ava (13f) who knew what it was and said she wanted one too. My brother asked if I would give it to Ava for her birthday.

I said no, it’s for my wife, but I could make one with Ava. It would help teach her some basic woodworking skills which they don’t do in schools here anymore. I’d like that. Brother said if it was so easy then I could make a second one for my wife and just give this one to Ava since her bday is the end of the month.

Again I said no, this was done specifically for my wife. He seemed to accept that but then came back to me and said “Isn’t it a little weird to make a dollhouse for an adult woman?” I told him it’s not a dollhouse, just a fancy shelf. He argued that makes it worse, because Ava would actually “play” with it.

He must have gone to complain to mom about it (he is the younger brother) because mom called me to tell me that it was “stupid” to give my wife a dollhouse. I tried to explain that it’s not a dollhouse but she just kept saying “that’s stupid.” 

This weekend I was at their house and Ava kept bringing up the house and laying it on thick with statements like “I’ve alway wanted one just like it.” She kept asking why my wife wanted a dollhouse. I said it’s not a dollhouse, but she kept asking why she needed a dollhouse.

I told my brother that he was encouraging his kid to be manipulative and I really didn’t like it, so I was going to leave. He told me that I was dangling the house over her head like McDonald’s and teasing her and that it made me a bad uncle.

Being a good uncle is important to me and I do feel for the girl because she’s a big fan too. I admit I have a blind spot for this because I don’t have kids and maybe I shouldn’t have shared the picture with my brother to begin with. Am I really the asshole for not just giving it to her? Yes, it WAS easy to make and I COULD make another quickly.

**Sorry guys Ava isn't my brother's biological daughter, there's a long story involved that I didn't want to add but I should've realized the age would be surprising.** I still see her as my niece regardless but I get why that would be alarming.

"AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesn't want my niece to see it? Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. 

My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. 

I’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. 

I said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. 

My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then.

About a month ago, my niece “Gabby” and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a “yucky” face and said “That’s soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn’t \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?”

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we’d pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom’s house for mother’s day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I’ve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said “But I said I was sorry!” over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they’re sorry to you doesn’t mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won’t do it again, and she hasn’t. 

My mom and sister say I’m expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn’t said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I’m going to hold it against her. 

I really don’t know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully. AITA?",Not the A-hole,1l542ki
"WIBTAH if I (F28) told my husband (M28) his ""sleep boundries"" went out the window when he had our son? Husband (we will call Brad), and I have been together 2.5 years. Had our son in January. Things have been pretty great, but this had me feeling kind of...annoyed?

Brad is diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which can make communication between us challenging at times, but we do our best.

We live in Europe, NOT US.

Since Brad has AuDHD, he only works at 50%, the other half is covered by a health insurance here on a temporary basis, and every few months he has to keep applying for more. It is stressful, as we wait for him to hopefully get on a permanent coverage. Since this is so up in the air, instead of me taking a full year of mat leave, he took a majority of the days in case his temp health insurance is denied for some reason, then he can keep his work schedule at 50% and still get paid on the days he has off.

Which means I went back to work part time. I WFH as a private teacher. I choose my hours, since my students USUALLY live in different countries, I chose some in the afternoon when Brad is home with our son, and at nights, when my students would be awake and Brad is also home. I only have one student in the evening, 23:00 - 23:30 twice a week.

This is to help with some income, and we discussed this before I event went back to work. He had asked no students past midnight. So if Baby is having issues sleeping, he can take care of him and hopefully get him to sleep.

Well, Brad got back on a schedule where he wants to go to bed at 23:00...every night. We try to, but with a baby, sometimes...it just does not happen. Baby sometimes will stay asleep when I put him to bed (I nurse him to sleep), and sometimes he wakes up screaming.

Well, last night I told Brad I had my student at 23:00, and I would try to have Baby sleeping by then. He asked me, ""What is your plan if Baby wakes up? My bedtime is 23:00, so hopefully you have thought of something.""

I said, ""Well, hopefully he stays asleep. If not, you will just have to take care of him, or put him on his play mat and entertain him.""

He resolutely said, ""Bedtime is 23:00, and I will go to bed.""

Come 23:00, Baby is in bed, and Brad is just getting out of the shower. I guess he woke up moments after I started with my student, as when I came out of the office, he was walking around with Baby. I took him, nursed him back to sleep and went to bed also shortly after 23:30.

This morning, he was a bit annoyed with me. When I tried to hug him good-bye as he was leaving to work, he did not hug me back. We always do this before he leaves, so I said, ""Are you upset with me still?""

He replied, ""Yes, you crossed my boundry. My bedtime is 23:00. We disucssed this. I go to bed, and anything past that is your problem to solve if Baby wakes up.""

He left for work...and I was just thinking...what??

I feel I need to have some discussion with Brad about this, but WIBTAH if I told him he has no more boundries with his sleep and he is being ridiculous?

"AITA for taking my niece on vacation after her parents planned one without her? My niece (11) is the youngest child with 4 older brothers. She’s also the youngest cousin/grandchild and the only girl. Between that and the fact that she was very sick when she was little, she’s a little spoiled by everyone except her parents. 

When she turned 11, she told her mom she wanted to go on a weekend trip with just her and her mom. Her mom made a big deal about her wanting to exclude her dad and brothers. They refused to do the trip and also didn’t plan anything for her birthday so I took her on her trip myself. 

Last month was one of her brothers birthdays. He decided that for his birthday, he wanted everyone to go to Mexico except for my niece. Her parents agreed that it was fair because if she wanted a trip without them, they can get one without her. They asked me if I could watch her for 10 days. 

My niece was so upset so I decided to plan a surprise trip for her. I have some clients in Miami so I arranged for us to go there for 5 days, drive up to Orlando for 3 days, then fly to New York for 2 days, where I also had to get some work done. It was technically a work trip but I was able to plan a lot of fun outings for my niece. 

Just before their trip to Mexico, I told my nieces parents that I had to be in Florida and New York for work during their trip but I could take her with me. Since it was so last minute, they had to agree as they didn’t have any other childcare and couldn’t miss this trip. 

She had a blast. We spent a day in Disney world, went to 2 broadway shows, spent most of our time in Florida on the beach, did a lot of shopping, got room service for the first time, and our tickets were upgraded so we flew first class on our way home. 

Her parents are mad that I spoiled her and undermined them so I don’t get to see her as much as I used to (I’m still their after school childcare so I see her a few days a week) and they’re going around telling extended family that I took their kid across the country without permission because I was upset about her being punished for being rude",Not the A-hole,1ohv42z
"AITA for taking unneccesary money out of my daughter's pocket? Basically, I have a daughter, Emily (16F) from a previous marriage. My wife Sasha, has a son the same age, Mark (16M). Mark doesn't stay with us that often, he prefers to stay with his bio dad. That being said, when he is here, I find Mark to be a pretty good kid, polite and respectful. 

His dad decided to take a trip for work, in the last few weeks of school, so Mark's here for a bit. He's out of the house most of the time and doesn't take up much space. He does get kind of grumpy when there’s too much going on around him, especially noise, but for that, his favourite thing are these expensive noise-cancelling headphones which he almost always has with him- a present from his dad. 

Emily’s school has already finished, so she's home. The problem is that the room Mark is, sometimes has miscellaneous items put in when he's not here and therefore Emily seems to think its fair game to go through his stuff. I've told her to stop, but Sasha hasn't been taking it seriously, imo, saying that most of Mark's stuff is easy to replace.

The big problem happened when Mark accidentally left his headphones in his room, and Emily accidentally snapped them. 

Mark found out when he came home from school and flipped. He shouted at her, saying she was 'spoilt without anything to back it up', loud enough that my wife and I heard it from the other room. Sasha wanted me to calm things down, which I did- but I also told Emily she’s replacing them.

Thing is, Mark’s dad offered have someone get him a new pair immediately, and that it wasn't a problem. I said Emily would pay him back, and I'm sticking with it. 

Emily and Sasha think that’s unfair since Mark’s dad can afford to buy 10 more. But I don’t think you get to break someone’s stuff and not pay for it. Those aren't the values I was raised with or what I want for my daughter.

That being said, I do realise in this case its kind of unnecessary and there may be better ways for her to make it up to him. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,1lbuzuj
"AITA for refusing to give up my seat on the plane so a boy could sit next to his father, and to tell the father to behave himself? Edit: 

I used to read all those posts where people said they didn't expect this to blow up. Well I thought I'd get like a dozen answers. But almost 2 million views in 24 hours is crazy lol. Many people are wondering why I'm insisting on a window seat. I like to look out but mainly if I need a nap that is unlikely to happen if I can't rest my head against the window. Other than that I hate aisle seats a lot, equally if not more than middle seats. People and the drinks trolley keep bumping into you. I don't understand why anyone would choose to sit there. It takes the trolley bumping into you once to change your mind. 

Original post:

So basically I (29M) boarded my short flight (70 min) which has a 2-2 seating arrangement. I had booked myself a window seat and when I got there I saw a maybe 7 year old boy sitting in there, next to his father (about 50 y/o) in the aisle seat. The opposite row also had his mother and his sister sitting there.

Although this happened less than 24h ago I was exhausted so I don't remember the conversation word for word. 

I pointed towards my seat and the father asked me if I would mind swapping so they could sit together, and that their seat is in the row behind it. I said that I would only swap if it is a window seat, and he said it is an aisle seat. Then I said I wouldn't swap and the following conversation happened 


- Him: So do you want to sit next to my son?
- Me: I don't care I just want the window seat.
- Him: *standing up and getting his son up* you are a very nice person. I mean not a very nice person
- Me: It's none of your business and be polite.
- Him: I am not (referring to polite)
- Me: (I said something I don't remember) and behave yourself.

I just stood there looking at him serious, I think he was trying to shame me initially but he didn't respond 
anything else to that.

His wife was watching this the whole time. When somebody in the row behind saw it he offered to swap and sat next to me so they did eventually sit next to each other.

For all I care they could have sat 20 rows apart or even booked a new flight, I had zero investment in this or their reasons. They can ask, I can say no and that should be the end of it imo. 

I didn't like they basically pulled a fait accompli when trying to swap with me. If they care that much they can book their seats in advance like everyone else. I didn't have a good reason why I *need* the window seat except that I like it and don't like the aisle seat lol.

"AITA for not explicitly stating my punch is non-alcoholic? I (25F) recently attended a potluck-style work party, and brought punch, which has since caused a problem between myself and another coworker (42F), who we’ll call Sandy.
Last week, my boss hosted a party at his house to celebrate the end of the busy season, and a job well done. All of my coworkers and their spouses were invited, and we decided it would work well to do a potluck to offset the cost of feeding everyone (about 35 people, since not everyone who came brought a spouse or significant other). I volunteered to make a punch that I’ve brought to previous work events that everyone said they enjoyed, as well as some fruit to go with it. This was a casual party with alcohol present, but since I have some coworkers who don’t drink, I didn’t add any alcohol to this punch, and figured that if people really wanted some they’d just add it themselves. Fast forward a couple hours, and Sandy is getting even louder and more dramatic than normal, and is stumbling around the party. I didn’t think much of it and figured she brought her own drinks, or was adding some of the hosts alcohol that was put out into something else. She suddenly fell off the chair she was sitting on, and made a big show of saying that it’s because she was so drunk- she then asked me, in front of the rest of our coworkers, what it was that I put in the punch. I was confused, and told her what was in it (just a mix of gingerale, 7up, orange juice, and a can of juice concentrate), and she wanted to know what alcohol I put in it, because she’s been drinking it all night, and is “really feeling it”. I told her that I didn’t put any alcohol in it, and asked if maybe someone else had spiked the punch bowl- nobody said they added anything, and one of my coworkers who doesn’t drink even said that they’d also been drinking the punch all evening, and was still completely sober. I also would like to clarify that I understand how context can matter, like if everyone else was really drunk then that can make even a sober person feel like they’re loaded, but that definitely was not the vibe- Sandy was the only person acting “drunk”. She then got really quiet, and went by herself to the bathroom. The rest of my coworkers and I exchanged some awkward glances, and tried to laugh it off. She left shortly after, and I received an angry text from her about how I shouldn’t have embarrassed her like that, and that now she looks like an “idiot” in front of our bosses, and the rest of our coworkers. She’s been hostile to me at work ever since, and is basically refusing to talk to me. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and most of my coworkers agree with me, but some say that I should have just let her go on thinking that the punch was alcoholic to save her the embarrassment, and I’m wondering now if I’m in the wrong.

"AITA for telling my Sister-In-Law to get out of my daughter’s baby shower? I (47F) have a daughter (25). She is currently 26 weeks pregnant with her second child (a girl). Her first child, Phillip, was stillborn two years ago at 38 weeks (a little boy). When she lost him, she asked us to take apart the nursery before she got home and “get rid of” the baby equipment (she saved his baby book, his ultrasound photos, and the outfit she planned to bring him home in, along with a lock of his hair in a memory box). 

She’d had a baby shower for Phillip when she was pregnant, but her grief around his death was so strong that she couldn’t handle having the nursery and baby things. We offered to return the baby shower gifts to the givers, most kindly refused and asked us to donate the items… except my husband’s sister, Rachel (43). She made a HUGE deal out of my daughter being “hysterical” and constantly, loudly talked about how “ridiculous” it was to take apart the nursery. We kept her away from my daughter and only allowed her to return to family functions when she promised to stop bringing it up. 

We recently held a baby shower for my daughter’s new baby girl. Rachel (along with the rest of my husband’s female relatives) was invited. She kept making quiet remarks to everyone that we were “tacky” for having a baby shower for a second child, but since she didn’t get near my daughter, I ignored it. When my daughter began opening gifts, it hit the fan. She loudly said “if you hadn’t torn Phillip’s nursery apart and gotten rid of everything, you wouldn’t be here begging for presents for this baby.”

My daughter froze and just stared off into space. Tears started running down her face. I just said “Rachel, please leave.” She refused and started arguing with me. I took her present out of the pile, walked to the door, and threw it out. I yelled “Get out, NOW!!!” and my husband came into the room and asked what happened. His mom told him and he physically picked up his sister and put her down outside the door. 

Now the family is divided over whether I should’ve yelled at her to get out and thrown her present. AITA?

UPDATE: we are having a family meeting (without Rachel) while my daughters and their partners are away at Hot Springs this weekend. Will update again after the meeting. 

UPDATE 2: The meeting went well. My husband and I gave a brief summary of what happened, backed up by witnesses. The relatives that couldn’t make the shower are now aware of what happened. The family consensus is that Rachel is unequivocally to blame and should not be allowed to be around my daughters or their kids. Other people in the family brought up issues they’ve had with her in the past along similar lines (especially involving pregnancy and kids). Rachel will no longer be included in large family gatherings. 

Those who want to continue a relationship with her will do so on their own, and have been informed that advocating for Rachel to be forgiven and included or feeding her information about me, my husband, or our kids and grandchildren will result in us going no contact with them as well. My mother-in-law has apologized profusely for making the remarks about being sad that she won’t have “both of her children” under her roof for the holidays anymore. We have accepted her apology because her feelings are valid and this is sad for her. Thank you so much for all your support.

"AITA for “letting” my girlfriend stop coming over in the mornings after my mom’s friend complained about her showering? 
My girlfriend works 12-hour overnight shifts (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.). After work, she sometimes comes to my place to shower and sleep. She usually arrives around 8:15 a.m., takes a quick shower by 8:30, then crashes for the day.

Here’s where the issue comes in: my mom’s long-term friend (who rents the basement) complained that the sound of the shower at 8:30 a.m. woke him up. My mom passed that complaint along to me and asked if my girlfriend could avoid showering until “everyone is awake.”

I told my girlfriend, and she felt uncomfortable continuing to come over understandably, in my opinion. After working all night, the last thing she wants is to feel like she’s disturbing people just by taking a basic shower before bed. So she decided not to come over in the mornings anymore. She didn’t cause drama or make a scene, just quietly adjusted.

I later told my mom what my girlfriend decided, and she got upset not because of the shower, but because my girlfriend chose to stop coming over in the mornings. My mom insists that wasn’t her intention, but from our perspective, asking someone not to shower after a night shift pretty clearly sends the message that their presence is disruptive.

For context: I also pay rent in this house. My mom’s friend has lived here for years and pays rent too. We all share the space. It’s not like my girlfriend was being loud or unreasonable just taking a 5–10 minute shower in the morning, which seems pretty standard.

Now my mom’s upset with me, but I feel like I handled it fairly. I passed the message along, my girlfriend made a calm and mature decision, and now somehow I’m caught in the middle.

"AITA My parents are forcing me to pay for my brothers grad school using money they never told me about I've (30F) been financially independent since graduating college. I worked practically full-time while studying, recently paid off my student loans on my own, and just started saving to buy a home. I didn’t apply to grad school because I couldn’t afford it, and my parents made it pretty clear growing up that we needed to stand on our own after high school.

My brother (22M) is honestly a genius. He worked really hard in school, got a full academic ride to a great state school, and graduated with honors. I'm so, so proud of him. The problem now is he recently got into an extremely prestigious grad program that would open a lot of doors for him. He was hoping for scholarships or a paid internship to cover most of it, but it’s not enough. Now he’s facing tuition and housing costs in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

My parents asked if I could help out and suggested I contribute around $15,000 to get him through the first year. They’d match it, and he’d take loans for the rest. I said no. I’ve been working for over a decade on my own goals, and I’m just now starting to save for a house. I don't feel comfortable putting that on hold, especially when I had to turn down opportunities because there was no help available to me.

During the conversation, my mom got frustrated and said they’d be using my “other fund” to help him instead. I asked what she meant, and she said they had set aside about $25,000 for me back when I was in college, meant to be used for a future wedding. I was completely blindsided. I had no idea this fund existed.

I asked why I wasn’t told about it when I was considering grad school, or now while I’m saving for a home. She said it was always intended for a wedding, not school or property, and since I haven’t needed it (I’m not engaged or in a relationship), they decided to give it to my brother because he has a more immediate need.

I'm not going to lie, I was pissed. I never got a chance to make a case for how I could’ve used that money, and now it’s just being handed over to someone else. I told them I felt hurt and left out. My mom said I was being unfair, and that the money was never promised, and if I didn’t want it for a wedding, then it made sense to use it for something meaningful.

My brother told me he didn’t know about the wedding fund either, and he understands why I’d be upset, but said he didn’t ask for it. He just wants to go to school and thought we were all trying to support each other.

"AITA for giving my daughter $60 a week, but my son nothing? I (45F) have two kids, 17F and 15M. We moved earlier this year to be closer to my parents as my parents health is declining. My daughter was excited about the move, but my son has struggled to adjust.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go &amp; while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

ETA: The conversation took place over the course of the afternoon, and I didn’t immediately agree to the deal with my daughter. I offered it to my son first, who reiterated “hell no” and “get the fuck out of my room”.

I also should mention the reason I have the smallest room is due to the lack of insulation in the ceiling and flooring making it damp, and as we’re heading into winter I wasn’t sending either kid in there. The room also fits a single bed, and a set of drawers - with essentially no other space at all. We own the house in Auckland NZ, and I don’t have the spare cash to get it insulated at the moment (or even fit any of my equipment to work from home in there).",Asshole,1kp4ekd
"AITA for telling my roommate's friend about my heritage? I 21F am half Mexican and half Chinese. My parents came to the US before I was born, but thought it was very important for me to learn their native languages and participate in both of their cultures. Because of this, I can speak Spanish and Mandarin. Both of my parents also loved cooking, so growing up we ate a lot of traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes as well as some blended fusion meals as well.

A few nights ago, I was cooking dinner at my apartment. I was making one of those fusion dishes, but I got stuck on a particular step, so I called my mom to ask for help and we talked in Spanish. I was on the phone when my roommate, Ann 23F, came home with her friends, who I was not told were coming over.

Later, one of the guys from the group came into the kitchen and asked what I was making because it smelled  good. I explained the dish was created by my parents to blend Mexican and Chinese cuisine. He then asked why I was speaking on the phone in Spanish earlier, so I told him that I’m half Mexican and half Chinese, and that I grew up speaking both Spanish and Mandarin with my parents. He seemed genuinely interested and asked me more about the languages and the cooking, so we ended up talking for a while about my background and how food and language are such a big part of my life.

The next day, I found out through my other roommate that Ann had told her I was showing off and flirting with her friend. This pissed me off because I wasn't trying to flirt with him and he was the one who started the conversation with me. I tried to talk to Ann about this, but she just seemed annoyed and told me that it was obvious how it looked and I should be more mindful when she has her friends over. I told her that I can't be ""mindful"" if she doesn't even warn me about having company over. She said that she doesn't have to get my permission to invite people to the apartment. I was getting irritated by this point so I let the conversation die down after this.

It's been so awkward ever since this happened and every time I see her she's short with me and barely acknowledges me. I'm starting to wonder if I behaved out of line. AITA?

"AITA for telling my mom not to babysit anymore when my husband changed his mind? My husband is a lawyer and I’m an engineer. We both have intense careers but he wanted a second child. I was happy with our daughter but he really wanted another child. We now have 2 daughters aged (3 and 1) and I came back from maternity leave and my mom took over full time caring for them. We both work full time so she takes them when we work. My mom is a nurse but quit to look after our kids. I insisted we should pay her the going rate for daycares in the area which is around $1500 a child. So we pay $3000 for her to care for our children, cook for them etc. She will also pick them up sometimes as we may need to be in the office early.

My husband complained a lot about how expensive it was to pay her. He makes $140k and I make $110k so we can afford to pay her. But he thinks we are overpaying her and complained about it to her face. My mom is not very confrontational but she got very upset. I argued with him on this for months until I decided it was better for her to go back to work and for us to use daycare. Finding a daycare was hard and now we pay $1800 a child for daycare and daycares obviously will not pickup your children nor will they cook for them. We have less time now and at a higher cost for our children to be sick a lot during the winter season. So far this year we have been sick as an entire household 3 times. I was on a business trip and my husband was late picking up our children which resulted in a $75 late charge which my mom would have not charged extra for. My husband is now demanding that my mom leave her job to go back to babysitting our children but I won’t let her because he did no research into the real cost of childcare and kept complaining how expensive it is even when I showed him. 

My mom even part time makes $4300 a month as a nurse and I told my husband if we want her doing the child care we need to pay her that amount. Remember we already pay $3600 for daycare. He wants her to go back to the $3000 charge and is angry and claims my mom is asking for too much for such a simple job and that a grandma taking care of her grandchildren is a “privilege”. I told her not to quit and him that she isn’t babysitting which reduces his number of free hours and makes our lifestyle harder so he is angry at me for demanding we pay her what I feel she is owed. My mom probably would do it for free if we wanted but I definitely don’t think it’s fair. She needs to save for retirement and she has bills as well. AITA here? ",Not the A-hole,1iphoz8
"AITA for taking walks on my lunch break? A few years ago I started a job that was more office based than previous jobs. Because of that, I was moving less and gaining some weight and I am very out of shape. I’m not overweight, but I’m carrying a little more fat than I’m used to and I can tell my cardio ability has gone down. 

I get a one hour paid lunch per day. A lot of my coworkers eat at their desk and do a little work, like maybe answering an email. But mostly eating. I personally go to my car to eat and then do laps around the parking garage before I go back in. I am never gone for more than an hour, I am back on time. 

Recently I did my normal routine. I grabbed my lunch, went to my car and ate it, then I started on my walk. I happened to run into a coworker during my walk. He was out there because he forgot needed something from his car. He stopped me and asked what I was doing. I told him I ate my lunch and now I am taking a walk before my lunch break is over. 

He didn’t like that answer and said our lunch break is for eating, not walking, and that when I am done eating, I should go back to work. I told him we are given an hour for lunch, I want to use all of it in the best way I can. 

I think he told other people because then, I’ve been receiving comments before I go on break that I didn’t receive before. I don’t think I was wrong, I’m entitled to my break, all my work gets done on time, I take it at about the same time every day so it’s expected I won’t be available, and I maybe come back to a few non-urgent emails. I have my phone on me in case someone calls for an emergency, which has never happened. 

I talked to my parents about it and they both said they work through lunch and I shouldn’t be out walking. But also they’re older and raised in a different time, so I don’t know if I should trust their judgement. 

So AITA for taking a walk during my lunch break?

ETA: it’s paid. A lot of people think it’s unpaid. I am paid for it. I’m salary. My manager doesn’t have an issue but some people I work with do have an issue knowing I use part of it to walk. ",Not the A-hole,1mfcaue
"AITA for letting my daughter flaunt her expensive items I (50F) and my husband (48M) have a daughter, Danica (21F), who has been extremely independent her whole life. Danica began working when she was 15, and now she works part-time for a large corporation while pursuing her studies. We are extremely proud of her and how hard she has worked. We generally allow her to manage her own finances, and she insists on contributing monthly to family expenses with the money she earns. Danica occasionally likes to make pricier purchases, which I do not have any concern over, as I think they are sensible financial choices. Like last year, she decided to purchase the newest MacBook as her old laptop was on its last leg, and she wanted something reliable and long-lasting or when she bought a Marc Jacobs bag for work and university. 

We recently went on a family trip with my brother and his family, who have two kids of their own, Tammy (20F) and Nick (23M). His kids and Danica aren't exactly close, but they get along fine for the most part.  I know that Tammy and Nick do not have any source of income besides my brother and have not worked a day in their life. During the trip, Danica would occasionally pay for the 3 of them for small things like drinks or food. When we were shopping, Danica bought a  few items for herself and picked up gifts she wanted to bring back to her friends. During dinner that night, my sister-in-law (brother's wife) told my husband and me that we were spoiling Danica too much with her purchases. We explained that Danica earned her own money, and every cent came from her job. Sister-in-law then proceeded to point and tell Danica that if that was the case, she shouldn't be flaunting her purchases and items in front of her cousins, who don't have a 'cushy little office job' and parents who 'spoiled her into the person she is'. Danica apologised politely, saying that she didn't mean to flaunt her things, but I could tell that she was upset and embarrassed. My husband stood up and shot back, saying that Danica shouldn't have to apologise for her own hard work. I also pointed out that Danica has been financially independent since she was 15 and that we've always done our best not to spoil her. Sister in Law then proceeded to tell us that we weren't teaching her how to manage her finances correctly and that all this money had turned her into a little 'brat'. Danica excused herself to the bathroom and texted that she had gone back to the hotel. We had a tense back and forth for the rest of the dinner, and we came back to finding Danica crying in her hotel room. I call my brother, hoping that he is able to talk to his wife, but he explained that for the past few days, Tammy had been crying to her parents about not having what Danica had. She had been whining to her mum that she wanted the newest MacBook, as well, but she refused to get it for her.

  
Myself, Danica and my Husband have been getting calls from the rest of the family, some calling us A-holes and some who were willing to hear us out and understand where we were coming from. So AITA?

"AITA for telling my MIL if she keeps rearranging my Kitchen she can get a hotel room? I (29F) am married to a wonderful man (30M) who is also the brother of my best friend, our heights are very different with me being 6'6"" and him being 5'7"", all of his family are on the short side and it led to some adjustments in our living arrangements at first but we found what worked for us. We realised early on that it was easier for him to use a step stool to reach what he needed in the kitchen than for me to constantly be crouching to get what I need as that gets painful quickly for me.

This was fine, until my MIL came to stay with us two weeks ago. Her roof needs repairs, my husband and I have a spare room while my best friend doesn't so it was only logical she come stay with us. She has constantly been moving things about in the kitchen, lowering items as she doesn't want to use the step stool, which isn't anything to do with her age or fearing she'll fall she just doesn't want to. She keeps harping on about how it's ridiculous everything is so high up and it's rude for guests. My husband has repeatedly shut her down stating my comfort matters more than theoretical guests and asked her not to move things. She lets it go for a day then things are moved again. 

I've expressed frustration to my Husband about this and the final straw came today when I went to make myself a coffee and could not find my coffee mugs anywhere, it took me five minutes to find them in my kitchen and I found them in the lower cabinet that I had to kneel to get them out of. I was angry and snappish at this as my back had hurt from getting my mug, and I told her if she couldn't stop herself from rearranging my kitchen she could get a hotel room as I have had enough of her entitlement. 

This led to a lot of blustering and some tears that she was just trying to make it make more sense and how this is her sons home and how it's just a little reorganisation and that they shouldn't all suffer just because i'm tall, she then also began to say how i'm heartless to expect her to stay in a hotel over the holidays. 

My Husband was clearly uncomfortable at this and didn't want his Mother upset but he told her that it wasn't just his home, but mine too and if she wouldn't respect my comfort and happiness then she would have to leave. She has went into the guest room and I can hear her crying still. My Husband is clearly getting anxious and upset over this but he's not backing down and I feel awful that my snapping led to him feeling like this, maybe I should have just put up with it or been more gentle about how I dealt with it? I honestly don't care that she's upset which may make me sound heartless but I hate that my Husband is feeling this way.",Not the A-hole,1hhtdph
"AITA for telling my co-worker her kids are none of my business? School holidays are coming up and I have a co-worker panicking, as she left it too late to book vacation slots. My company had a rule where no more than 3 workers can leave at the same time for vacation. I already filled in my vacation slot months ago as I haven’t taken any in nearly a year. I’m single and unmarried and in my 30s. Company HR told my co-worker that her only way to get her vacation is to get one of us who already had our vacation time approved to ‘trade with her’. And considering out of the three of us whose vacations were approved, I am the only female, guess who my co-worker approached for the trade?

She tried explaining (gently at first) that her kids (6 and 4 years of age apparently) were really looking forward to going to Disneyland and that everything is already booked, and if I can give up my vacation spot to her. I told her no, as I too already had my vacation booked (it’s a solo vacation but I’m not about to tell her that). She got real pushy and kept on trying to insist I give her my vacation spot, saying that “My kids would be so disappointed”. I blew up at her after the fourth or fifth time, telling her that her “kids being disappointed” is none of my business.

I didn’t exactly keep my voice down so at least half the office heard, and my co-worker turned red and left. One of my co-workers (25M) who sat to my side who had heard the entire conversation later told me that while he get where I’m coming from, I could be a lot gentler, and “I didn’t get how hard mothers get it”.

"AITA for locking myself in my office when we have company? I 36 F took in my mother during the pandemic after some medical issues. I never made her move out after, It works for us, she has her own bedroom and bathroom, we share other spaces and I work from home most of the time so I can look after her. My stepdad died about a decade ago and she was lonely. It made sense for us.

As mentioned I work from home most of the time and a lot of times i'm in some kind of teams meeting or call (yes even those that could be emails but thats not important). So I don't really have time for chitchat during office hours. My mom's sister aka my aunt tends to drop by unannounced to visit with my mom. Which I don't really mind, but she had a tendancy  to step into my office without knocking while i'm working and start talking to me about her neighbors sisters kid who did bla bla bla. I've more than once explained to her that I'm working and or I'm on a call and I can't really chat right now. But she just keeps talking like nothing happened.

Today she actually announced to my mom she was coming over. I reminded my mom to tell her I'm working and on calls and can't be disturbed and my mom agreed she would tell her not to bother me. But just to be safe I locked my office door so she couldn't walk in.

Despite my mom telling her, she came upstairs and tried to open the door, when it didn't open she started knocking and calling out hello it's me open up. I didn't respond at first as I was on a call with a client but she kept banging on the door so loudly I ended up having to put the client on hold. I told her without opening the door I was on a call and could not talk right now and my aunt left in a huff. Now she's bombarding my mom with texts about how rude I was for locking myself in my office knowing I was having company.

So AITA?

Update: Go to dinner for a few hours, return to reddit only to find out this has exploded. First of all thank you all for your confirmation that this isn't on me. I did not think I was the asshole, but there's always that hint of doubt where you're like hmmm maybe I should have poked my head out and said hello real quick, but the truth was it was a busy day today and I just hadn't had the time.

Now for the update: After I finished my workday, I took my mom out for dinner and we discussed the matter. She hadn't responded to any of her sisters (my aunt's) texts because she is fully on my side. I know people are asking why my mom didn't stop her, my mom isn't very mobile anymore and my aunt simply got up from her seat and took off upstairs despite my mom's warning.

We discussed it over dinner and we agreed that my aunt simply is no longer welcome during office hours, since it's the only way to stop this behaviour, either she can pick up my mom to go to a coffee shop and talk, come after office hours, or come over on the one day I work in office. My aunt seems pretty pissy about it, calling their brother (my uncle) to complain also, but he texted me earlier saying he told her how wrong she was and apparantly her husband had also told her she was wrong so now she's currently stomping her feet at home because everybody is saying she's wrong. Delightfull woman she is... remind me to one day post the story about her disneyland trip.

Anyways TLDR: Mom and I decided she's no longer welcome at my house during office hours.

Update to the update: This is the cliffnotes version of the Disneyland story 

She has twin boys, and for their birthday she booked a trip to take them an one of their friends out to disneyland. The friend ended up cancelling last minute and told me if I paid the friends share I could go. Reasonable enough , I figured why not. (I was 16 at the time this story is like 20 years old) I'm european so this is disneyland Paris i'm talking about, and I'm not from France so this is a international trip (this becomes important later) my cousins are maybe 10ish at this point. So anyways we're in the parks and she has been a menace all trip already but i'm dealing with it. It's the last day about 5 hours before we have to take our train back home (international traveling train with customs etc like a plane would be only less boarding time)

One of my cousins wants to go on the rock and roll rollercoaster the other one doesn't. The line is like 5 minutes or less so my aunt tells me to go with him and she'll wait at the exit with our bags. So I leave my bag containing my phone my ID my money EVERYTHING in her care.

Ten minutes later me and my cousin get out of the ride, and she is GONE. So I start looking around, cannot find her, after half an hour of waiting (maybe they went to the bathroom or something) still nothing. We go check the bathrooms, neighboring rides the works no aunt. I have no phone on me to call her, and with us having to leave for the train in 4 hours I get nervous. I'm a 16 year old with a ten year old at my hand and no money no ID no phone nothing.

So I decide to go to the lost kids department and explain my situation. They end up calling her through the parks intercom.. another hour goes by... no Aunt. I remember my dad's phone number back home so I use Disney's land line to call him, he tries calling her cellphone my cellphone no response whatsoever. At this point I have like an hour or less before the train leaves and i'm in hystericals because I can't board this train without money or ID let alone with another minor. My cousin at this point seeing my panic is crying his eyes out so i'm also dealing with a scared child i'm barely an adult myself.

My dad eventually tells me it makes no sense for him to drive out to Paris right now, to go back to our hotel he'll pay for another night and he'll come pick us up in the morning. So I take my cousin back to the hotel explain the situation and the receptionist hears me say my name and says:"" Oh sweetheart I have a note for you"" it's a note from my aunt: Gone to dinner see you on the train...

At this point I have half an hour to run to the station , hoping we'll still get through customs where she's supposed to be waiting. I make it with 15 minutes to spare i'm out of breath, and FUMING. We end up making it through customs god only knows how and manage to get on the train literally as the doors close on us. I call my dad explain the update and he is also fuming at this point. To which my aunt turns to me and goes: I don't know why you're so mad, I left a note at the hotel and I brought you something to eat and hands me a freaking dinner roll..

I took my stuff, went to the dining car with my cousin who she also almost abandonned and gave him the biggest slice of chocolat cake my budget could buy and never came back to our seats to talk to her xD",Not the A-hole,1lvjcek
"AITA for being furious that my husband gave away my sake and wine after I told him repeatedly not to? I (30F) came back from Japan about two months ago and brought home an expensive bottle of sake I specifically picked after doing a sake tasting class. I'm not a big drinker, so I chose something I genuinely liked and that my husband would enjoy. It was meant as a ""for us"" thing. I also had an unopened bottle of German wine that a friend gifted me three months ago.

My husband and I had multiple conversations where he asked if he could give the sake to his father, his cousin, or his friends, and I said a strict no every single time. Not vaguely, not jokingly, very clearly. He knew it was sentimental and partially a souvenir. He also refused to drink it the one time I opened it because he had a headache, so I had about 20 ml and left the rest untouched.

Fast forward to three days ago: I'm away from home, and he has friends over after a pub night. I didn't even consider that he would touch the sake or the wine because we've had the ""don't share this"" conversation *a million times*.

The next day, I ask him where the sake is. He casually tells me he shared the sake and the unopened wine with his friends, and they finished everything.

I was stunned. Angry. Disappointed. All of it. He then says he ""forgot"" that I told him not to give it to anyone. Then adds that he doesn't remember unimportant stuff. Bear in mind, I had even given him a bottle of whisky specifically meant for his friends after I returned from my travel.

When I confronted him about the sake and wine, he flipped it and said ""Don't let it spoil our relationship"" and suggested I see a counselor.

AITA for being this upset over something he claims is ""not a big deal,"" even though I'd told him explicitly and repeatedly not to touch it? I'm unable to process the fact that my husband casually crossed a major boundary and is nonchalant about it.

"AITA for correctly guessing my friend's baby's sex? On the weekend my wife (38f) and I (39m) went to our friend's ""gender reveal"". For background information, our friend already has 2 boys, and she told my wife that she is hoping for a girl this time. 

In the car on the way there, my wife asked me what gender I thought the baby would be. I said that given that the sex ratio at birth is about 105 boys for every 100 girls, that my guess is that this child would be a boy. 

My wife said that given our friends had 2 boys already, that surely there would be more chance of a girl this time. I replied that the 2 boys were not relevant to the sex of the child our friends were expecting, and that there was still about a 51% chance this child would be a boy. 

At the ""gender reveal"", it was announced that this child would also be a boy. Although our friend tried to appear happy at the party, it was clear that she was disappointed that this child would not be a girl. My wife also appeared to be disappointed as well. 

On the drive back home, my wife got angry with me, and said that I ""could have been more supportive"" and that I ""shouldn't have been so mathematical"" with my guess about the baby's sex.  
Edited to add: ""could have been supportive"" referred to my guess that the child would be a boy, and my reasoning for that guess. 

I told her that my response was perfectly reasonable to the questions she asked me. She didn't like that and stayed quiet for the rest of the drive home.

"AITA for agreeing with my daughter it is weird her friend's mom has access to their conversations? My daughter is 14 years old and has a friend ""Chloe"". She and Chloe have been friends for a little over a year now. Chloe's mom ""Gina"" is someone I'd consider pretty strict. I was aware she'd check Chloe's phone (and I know a lot of parents do this), but I found out a few months ago through my daughter that she'd respond through Chloe's phone to Chloe's friends, including my daughter. It was never anything overkill, just ""Chloe can't talk right now, she's busy with homework"" or whatever. I thought this was odd but didn't say anything to Gina about it because that's her life and her business. 

I got a call from Gina earlier this afternoon. She was very pissed off and told me that my daughter was rude, I needed to start monitoring what she says, etc. I asked her what exactly happened and she said my daughter gave her an attitude via text. I was still very confused and asked why they were texting. Gina became exasperated and snapped ""Through Chloe's phone!!"" I told her I'd call her back and asked my daughter specifically what happened. My daughter willingly showed me her texts. She had texted Chloe something. Gina had responded (using Chloe's phone) saying Chloe was busy. My daughter replied asking when Chloe would be available to talk. Gina told her ""When she's ready, stop texting her"". My daughter replied ""You don't have to be so rude"". Gina said she wasn't being rude. My daughter said yes, Gina was, and also called her a weirdo for using Chloe's phone. 

I told my daughter next time, just don't engage. I did also say it wasn't kind to call someone a weirdo and not to do it again, but that I also understood her frustration. I didn't punish her, she seemed receptive to the talk and I left it at that. I called Gina back and told her I had spoken to my daughter and handled the problem. Gina started ranting that I need to monitor my daughter's phone and have I seen some of the things she talks about? She started on crushes, rants about teachers, saying there were times my daughter badmouthed me when frustrated. I said that's all fine, I'd rather her have a safe space to vent with her friends, after all, she's a teenager. Gina kept pressing on the issue and what would be done. I told her nothing, I spoke with my daughter and handled it. Gina said ""But she insulted an adult!"" I told her I handled it, but my daughter also didn't say anything that wasn't true, Gina \*was\* acting like a weirdo.

Now, Gina is angry with me, My daughter doesn't care that I said all of this. However, my husband thinks that I shouldn't have said it, as it didn't solve anything, and Gina can parent how she wants.

"AITA for not covering my friend's meal when she ordered more? So me and a group of friends went out to eat after midterm. It was a casual places where you pay at the end, and everyone was ordering whatever they wanted.

I got something small as usual because I’m trying to save some cash. So I had water and a basic pasta that was on special. A few others did the same. But one of my friend ordered a appetizer, a big entrée, and dessert, and she got a drink too. No judgment, she can do her, but it definitely added up.

When the check came, she suddenly goes, “Let’s just split it evenly.” I was like, what? I thought we were all paying for what we ordered. She said it would be easier and that it’s “what we always do,” which is not true by the way.

I told her I only brought enough for what I ate, plus a tip. She rolled her eyes and said it’s not that deep, and that I’m being cheap over a few bucks. But it wasn’t a few bucks. It would have almost doubled what I was planning to spend.

I didn’t budge and paid for my stuff only. My other friends didn't care and split the bill evenly.

"AITA for telling my 'friend ' she can yank her child when she has one? Title sounds weird I know but I 28F, had a friend 26 F  that I used to hang out with a lot. Recently we got into a accident where someone rear ended me. I had my baby in the car (3 months ), after the crash baby was absolutely hysterical, of course she would be, my friend then tried to scramble in the mix of it to take her out of her carseat. I do admit I may have said it harshly to not remove baby from their carseat until first responders got to us. The car was not on fire and we weren't in any mortal danger. 

On a normal day anytime my baby gets to the point of hysteria I soothe them, hug them, rock them, etc. That was a once in blue moon occurrence I didn't. I kept trying to shush and soothe baby from the seat but obviously she was scared and wanted her mama to hold her. 

At the hospital both my friend and I got the all clear and we were waiting on baby to be cleared, my friend went off on me telling me I'm a bad mom for not removing baby from the carseat. I simply explained to her, it was better for baby to stay in the seat incase there was spinal damage, the seat keeps the spine aligned and removing the baby from the carseat would cause further injury if there was already one. 

She kept berating me, I was frustrated already and I told her when she has her own and god forbid they get into a crash she can yank her kid out of the carseat and do as she pleases. She got quite and said I'm an asshole for bringing it up because she has trouble conceiving, she has PCOS,  and may not be able to carry a pregnancy to term.

"AITA for banning my wife’s Disney-divorce friend’s plug-ins from our house? My wife’s friend Melissa (49f) is staying with us for a few weeks while she sorts her life out. We have a large home and are very happy to have houseguests. She’s leaving her husband after 25 years of marriage because she wants to move to LA and work at Disneyland. This sounds like the plot of a bad sitcom, but I'm afraid it's it’s real. Both she and her husband are equally culpable for the failure of their marriage, and really bring out the worst in one another. Their relationship has been in a state for as long as I've known them.

The problem is Melissa showed up with an arsenal of room scents and sprays, and plugins. The smell (teenage girl with a side of forever chemicals/eau de Disneyland) has completely taken over the the hallway, the family bathroom, my office, and even down two flights of stairs into the foyer drawing room and living room. It’s strong, it's nasty, and it’s made of and smells like, all of the chemicals that we avoid.

Side bar – we've been cleansing ourselves of chemical nasties, and have curated our home to smell clean and subtle, it’s part of what makes it feel like home. Now it just smells like teen spirit.

Melissa is genuinely lovely and in a vulnerable spot, and I don’t want to make her feel unwelcome. But it’s our house, and this is something we’ve been intentional about. However... outside of our personal feelings about plugins it feels really out there to rock up in someone else's home and decide to bring your own plug in scents to totally change the smell of the house.

I mentioned how strong the smell was, assuming it was a room spray, and how it was overtaking every room, she said ""yeah the plug-ins are pretty strong"".  I was so shocked I asked her to remove them. I opened up with a sensitive ask ""hey those room sprays are pretty strong, would you mind keeping the door closed if you're using them"" and spiraled a bit when I heard her say *plugins* (plural).

My wife told me I was being an AH for making her uncomfortable when she is going through a lot, and that I could bitch to her about it was over the line to ask her to stop. I was incredulous that she thought it was okay to change the scent of our house.

Am I the AH here like my wife says? I feel pretty justified in my complaint.

EDIT:

To to address the frequently asked questions.

The plug-ins are already gone, the conversation pivoted from “could you please keep the door closed when you spray the room” to” can you please remove the plugins”. She apologised and removed them immediately.

I also spotted, after writing this post, that the intake vent for the central air was about twelve feet from where one of the plugins was. This explains how the whole house got gunked up so quickly. The smell still hasn’t gone 24 hours later. 

In the part of the conversation where the plugins were revealed my wife informs me that my facial expressions were all over the place, a mix of shock and disgust. I maintained a friendly but firm tone when I asked her to remove them, explained my reasoning clearly. I capped the conversation by saying I hated the smell of them, which was unkind and deeply unhelpful. In my defence genuinely do hate the smell and I was so throughly flabbergasted that an adult would think this is okay to do that I made an unguarded comment.

"AITA for blowing up at my sister for naming her daughter after a fungal infection? So my (20M) sister (27F) and her husband had been struggling a LOT with baby names. She was determined to find the single perfect name-- even by the time of her baby shower (nearly five weeks before the due date), she didn't seem any closer to picking something out than she was at the start of her pregnancy.

Anyway, I knew she was struggling, so in addition to the $900 wooden crib on her list that I got for her, I gave her a list of (obviously) joke baby names. We have a really close relationship, and it was in line with both our senses of humor.

She's a nurse, and I'm a biology student, so all the names were medications, infections, unpleasant animals, etcetera, that all sound like lovely girls' names out of context. Some of them were a little bit obscure, sure, but I included some obvious ones like ""Viagra"" and ""Hernia"" for good measure.

Two weeks later, she told me she and her husband had finally settled on a name.

Malassezia. The baby's name is Malassezia. One of the names on my joke list. Outside of the immediate issues (nearly impossible to pronounce on the first try, the ""ass"" smack dab it the middle of it, the first syllable being mal-, literally meaning bad or evil), it's also the name of a very common fungal infection. One that my sister and I are both genetically predisposed to. *One that we've both had multiple times throughout our lives.* Her daughter will almost certainly catch it at some time!

I pointed it out to her, and she said that yes, she knew what it meant, and she knew my list was intended to be a joke, but she just *really* liked the way it sounded. (I don't think the husband knows what it means- I think he'd reject it if he did.) She says that it's so obscure that no one will ever think twice about it. (Except, you know, when little baby Malassezia turns 14, finds a weird spot on her neck, and goes on her phone to google what it is...)

I told her that the name was completely unacceptable, and I was shocked that she chose it. I even suggested some similar names, like Mallory, Azalea, or Anastasia, that would be more acceptable, but she wouldn't hear it! She said that since I'm not one of the parents, I have no business telling her what she can and cannot name her child, and that I'm stepping way out of line. I think it's pregnancy hormones, and she'll regret the decision very soon after her daughter is born.",Not the A-hole,1kkh3py
"AITA for celebrating my birthday without my friends after they rescheduled around babysitters again? I've (26F) been part of this friend group since college. We're close and consistently hang out and have friend game nights. The kicker? I'm the only person in the group without kids. Everyone else is busy raising toddlers and infants!

While it seems fair that they've been putting on more and more ""adults only"" events - fancy dinners, wine tastings, and events - great right? Um... no. The adults only events are literally during times that I'm working my restaurant shifts (evenings/weekends) because those are the times their babysitters are available.

I've expressed multiple times that it would be great to have daytime events or meet during the week to do things since my schedule is very flexible during the day. They always say, ""oh we'll try that for the next time"", but it never happens.

Last month was the last straw. My birthday fell on a Sunday, and I asked them if we could do a celebration during the day since I was working that night, and they agreed. Then the day before my celebration the group chat exploded that they were actually now changing it to evening because ""Sarah's babysitter cancelled but can do 7pm instead"".

I was so done at that point. I made my own plans for my birthday with my coworkers who were able to show up and post pictures on social media having the best time at brunch and escaping an escape room.

Now my original friend group is hurt that I ""didn't even tell them"" we changed the plans. They are now calling me petty and that I should understand that finding childcare is hard, but I'm ovèr being the only one who is expected to accommodate everyone else 100% of the time. 

But I think my job counts as an adult responsibility too and I shouldn't have to miss my own birthday for their babysitter problems.

"AITA for not changing my daughter's wedding venue even though my sister's husband proposed to his 22-year-old mistress there last month? I (51F) put down a $20K non-refundable deposit on this gorgeous beachfront estate for my daughter , let's call her Amy's (26F), wedding next September. We booked it 18 months out. For context, and without revealing too much, it's THE venue in our area, and it has been Amy's dream wedding spot in all of her pinterest boards.

Last month, my sister -- let's call her Carol (53F) -- found out her cheating ex-husband -- let's call him Mark (55M) -- proposed to his coworker (28F - she was 22 when they started having an affair) who he had been having an affair with. The woman posted engagement photos from the same venue... Specifically the beautiful beach area where Amy plans to have her ceremony.

Carol is obviously destroyed. She called me sobbing, begging me to change venues. Says she can't watch Amy get married where Mark proposed to a girl younger than his own daughter. Can't smile for photos on THAT beach.

I feel sick for her. I do. But:

* $20K non-refundable deposit
* Save-the-dates already sent
* Amy's dreamed of this venue since high school
* Everything else is booked or 3x the price

I told Carol I can't lose $20K and crush Amy's dreams because Mark is trash. Carol says I'm choosing money over her mental health. That I'm forcing her to relive the worst betrayal of her life for ""pretty pictures.""

I also talked to Amy about it and she does not want a venue change. That it's not her fault Mark -- who has been out of all out lives for the last 5 years -- ruined that place for Carol. Carol called Amy a ""spoiled brat who wouldn't understand real pain.""

Now Carol's skipping Thanksgiving. My and carol's side of the family (her daughters and to some extent, my parents) says I'm heartless. The place is cursed anyway, why should we host Amy's big day there.

My husband's side of the family says Carol doesn't get to hijack Amy's wedding because her husband's a cheater.

"AITA for asking my partner stop telling me to “lower your volume.” Sometimes when I get excited about a topic, I naturally start speaking louder than usual. Not shouting, just louder than normal conversation level. The thing is, I don’t realize I’m doing it in the moment.

When this happens, my partner will often interrupt me mid-sentence to ask me to lower my volume. I don’t think they mean it in a rude way, and I understand that they probably just want the conversation to stay at a comfortable volume. That’s fair.

But every time it happens, I feel demoralised, and a little self conscious. I lose my enthusiasm and no longer feel like talking about the thing I was excited about. Even if they don’t mean it harshly, it still feels dismissive and discouraging. I’ve tried to explain how it makes me feel, but they still keep interrupting me.

Am I the asshole for wanting them to stop interrupting me like that? Or do I just need to accept that I should keep my volume in check? Even if it’s hard because I don’t always realize when I’m doing it?",No A-holes here,1kux0e4
"AITA for not letting my coworker stay at my place even though I “have the space” so I (23f) live alone in a small 2 bedroom house. one room is mine, the other one is basically my everything room. It’s my office, my closet, storage, sometimes i just lay on the floor in there and stare at the ceiling when life sucks lol. it is NOT a guest room. I’ve lived with horrible roommates before so I worked really hard to be able to afford my own place and I love having my space. it’s literally my safe little bubble.
anyways, one of my coworkers (25f) got into a huge fight with her roommates and they kicked her out. she was venting at work and i felt bad and was like “that sucks omg” and even sent her a few places to look at. I was trying to be helpful without inviting chaos into my life yk?

later that night she texts me saying “hey I was thinking maybe I could just crash with you for a few weeks since you live alone and have the space?”

i literally got that sinking feeling in my chest. nooo. no no no. i’m not even close to her. we’re cool at work but we’ve never even hung out outside of lunch breaks and complaining about our boss. she doesn’t know anything about me. and i don’t know her like that. why would she live in my HOUSE.

so i replied super politely like “i totally get that you’re going through it but i really value my space and I’m just not in a place where I can have someone stay with me” like i was NICE. didn’t ghost her. didn’t ignore her. just said no.

next day she’s acting really weird. then another coworker tells me she said i “let her be homeless” when i “have an entire room to myself.” like GIRL. first of all, she’s staying at her bf’s place. second of all, I pay to live alone. that’s the whole POINT. I don’t wanna feel tense or uncomfortable in my own space. I don’t wanna tiptoe around a person I barely know. and I definitely don’t wanna deal with “just a few weeks” turning into “i’m looking but nothing’s coming through yet” for 2 months.

now ppl at work are acting like I’m the bad guy. sorry for not letting a coworker move into my apartment bc she had a bad fight? idk. i feel bad but like. also no.

she went to jail, lol. Don’t know what happened but I feel horrible to say I laughed. Well, solves that issue.

"AITA for hiding my expensive shampoo and conditioner from my friend’s guest? I (28F) share an apartment with my friend (34M). Last weekend, while we were away, he invited his female friend (Sarah) to stay over. When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking. I had splurged on these expensive products to treat myself. I also make a lot less money than my friend.

Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend’s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn’t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she’s his guest, and it’s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her.

"AITA for giving my son's girlfriend a budget for the dinners she's making? My son (23M) graduated university back in June and he moved back across the country to live with us since he found a job in the area. He’s been in a long distance relationship with his girlfriend, Carmella (21F) until October. She initially took a semester off from college and was living with her mom. However, she’s decided she’s not going back. Her mom said she would have to move out and she had nowhere to go. My son is moving into his own place in January and had invited her to move in already, saying she could get a job in the area. However, she needed to move out sooner, and they both asked me if she could move in. I agree. Neither are paying rent as I personally don’t believe in charging my kids to live here, so it felt wrong to charge Carmella any. I just asked that they clean up after themselves and be respectful of everyone. They agreed. Carmella moved in after Halloween and she’s been a joy to have here. She’s still looking for a job. Most nights, she’s offered to cook dinner to give back to us. I’ve always told her it’s not necessary, but she insists. She’s a good cook, so I tell her if she wants to, have at it. 

A week into her living here, she mentioned wanting to make a certain dish but we didn’t have the ingredients. I offered to give her my card so she could buy groceries. Since then, it’s become a regular thing. I didn’t mind it initially. She picked up my groceries as well, and it seemed to be a good deal all around. But then a couple of weeks in, she started wanting to make multiple trips a week and buy things that I normally wouldn’t budget for on a regular basis, such as steak and seafood. I asked her on Sunday when she went to the store to please get everything she needed in one trip. She said okay. I thought that solved the problem.

Cut to Monday night, and we finish dinner. She and my son are talking while I’m doing the dishes. Carmella mentions wanting to make steak on Thursday. My son says that sounds good. Carmella says she’ll have to go back to the store. My son turns to me and says “Mom, give her the card.” I tell them no. I say I already gave her money to go shopping on Sunday and told her to get everything she needed. I also said we can’t swing everyone having steaks this week  (6 people in the house), but maybe I can make them for Christmas dinner. I then go on to say if Carmella wants to keep cooking for us, which I appreciate, I am going to put her on a budget. I apologize for not doing it sooner. Carmella looks upset and my son seems offended. Later on, my son tells me I “embarrassed” Carmella when she’s just trying to be nice. I said I appreciate her cooking dinner, but she’s doing it on my dime, and I can’t afford this. I pointed out he’s free to give her money to do this. My son pointed out they’re only here “a few more weeks”, can’t I just make “my guest” happy?

"AITA for Ruining My Family’s New Year’s Eve by Refusing to “Join the Fun” Because I Didn’t Want to Be the DD Again? Hey Reddit, I (26F) need some serious perspective. I’m starting to think I might be the asshole, but I still feel like I’m in the right lol.

Every New Year’s Eve, my family has a big party at my aunt and uncle’s house and every year, without fail, I end up being the DD. Don’t get me wrong I love my family, but it’s starting to bug me. It’s been like this since I was 19, even before I was legally allowed to drink.

I don’t drink much—maybe a glass of wine or a beer, but I don’t get plastered. I’m fine with driving people home if they need it, but for the past few years, everyone expects me to not drink so I can drive them back. Every year, it’s the same: “Oh, can you drive? You’re not drinking anyway!” I always say yes because I don’t want to let anyone down.

Fast forward to this year’s New Year’s Eve. I told my family ahead of time I wasn’t going to be the DD anymore. I just wanted to enjoy the night, have a couple of drinks, and not be responsible for getting everyone home. I even told my cousin who usually gets really sloshed that I wasn’t driving this year, and she was fine with it.

When I got to the party, it was the usual chaos. People were drinking, laughing, and having a good time. I was enjoying myself, but around 11, my cousin came over and asked if I was ready to drive everyone home. I reminded her I’m not driving tonight, I’m here to enjoy the party. She looked at me like I was crazy and said, “Come on, you always drive! Don’t be a bitch.” Which like, wtf?

I tried to explain calmly that I wasn’t being a bitch, just that I wasn’t going to be the chauffeur anymore. Then, my aunt overheard and pulled me aside. She lectured me, saying, “We all agreed last year you’d be driving. You know how much we rely on you. Everyone else is too tipsy, and Ubering is so unsafe. Just drive this one time, for the family.”

I felt a ton of pressure but refused I told her I’m not their chaufeur and wasn’t going to do it again just because no one else could figure out their own ride. My aunt got upset, saying I was being selfish and that we’re family. She said I’m the only one who doesn’t get ‘too drunk,’ so it makes sense for me to help out. I told her I had already had three beers, so I wasn’t even legally supposed to drive myself.

That’s when I snapped. I told them it’s not my job to be their DD every year just because I’m the only one who doesn’t get blackout drunk. They needed to figure out their own rides this time. Then I got up and left. I felt bad walking out, but I didn’t want to be a doormat anymore.

I spent the rest of New Year’s Eve at home, watching Netflix and eating leftover pasta with my boyfriend. My family texted me, calling me dramatic, selfish, and saying I ruined the night. They said I was being “super sensitive” and that everyone was “disapointed” in me. Everyone's demanding an apology out of me even now.

And by the way, I got home perfectly safe by Uber. But anyways, Reddit, AITA?",Not the A-hole,1hvj7vh
"AITA for telling my coworker why customers might not like her I work at a restaurant as a server. One of my coworkers moved up here from Georgia for college and started working here a few months ago.

She constantly lays on the “southern charm” thing thick. She calls everyone “honey” and “sweetie” and all of that. She also tends to chit chat with people instead of just letting them eat after bringing them their food or drinks. It’s also kind of obvious that a lot of them don’t want to really talk to her, they give one word answers and she just barrels forward and talks at them.  (Management has told her off more than once for this) 

About two weeks ago she was upset because a customer yelled at her and said “Don’t call me that!” when she called her “honey” and she complains that she’s not getting as many tips as the other servers. She says it’s because she has a southern accent and customers think she’s stupid, but I don’t think that’s the case. 

She asked me for advice, and I said it’s because she takes so long to bring things out and wastes time trying to make small talk. I also said that the excessive pet names sound kind of condescending, and they aren’t really something you would call a stranger here. 

She told me that she wasn’t going to start being rude to customers because she would make even less money. I told her it’s not being rude, it’s just how things work here, and it’s rude to other customers she’s supposed to be serving when she spends all her time trying to make small talk instead of doing her job and calling them weird things.

"AITA for refusing to take my daughter to ""her"" birthday party? My (33F) daughter “Cleo” (5yo) hates pink. She has disliked the color and almost everything to do with it since she was about three or so. She has one pink shirt she likes and one pink stuffed animal, and that’s it.

My father’s partner, “Prue,” refuses to accept that Cleo doesn’t like pink. Over the years, she’s made several attempts to push the color onto her (pretty much every gift she’s ever given her was some shade of pink), no matter how many times I tell her to stop. She has tried to give me dozens of different reasons why I should encourage my daughter to “try different shades.” It clearly upsets Cleo, but Prue keeps doing it.

About a week ago, my father invited me, my husband and our children for dinner at his place. He said he and Prue had a surprise for the kids.

Right before we left home, my younger sister (who still lives with our father) texted me. She warned me that the “surprise” was actually a small birthday party Prue had planned for Cleo. That alone threw me off, because my daughter’s birthday was in November. My father did miss her actual birthday party due to work, but still. Also, my son turns 9 in March, so I had figured his would be the next party we’d have.

Then she sent me photos of how the place was decorated, and it very clearly wasn’t actually meant for Cleo. Literally every piece of decor was pink. The table, the tableware, the balloons, everything. She had gotten pink banners and glued pink foil fringe curtains on the doors. Even the cake was pink.

I showed everything to my husband, and we agreed not to take the kids there. I texted my father the following: “Hey, (sister) told me everything. We’re not coming. We’re taking the kids to McDonalds and telling them that was your surprise. You and Prue can come if you want, we’re paying.”

We did exactly that. My father did show up (without Prue), but he was cold with us and left 20 minutes after arriving.

Both him and Prue are pissed. My father is angry that my husband and I dismissed his partner’s “heartfelt gesture” towards our daughter. Prue also told me that I’m the reason Cleo is “restrictive” (I also don’t like pink), and I’m raising her to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat who is unwilling to compromise.

To be honest, I get how I could be in the wrong here. But at the same time, this just felt like Prue trying to push something Cleo doesn’t like onto her yet again.

My sister and one of my brothers are on my side (though my sister did say I had been rude). My other brother is on the fence.

"AITA for not cooking ""fancier"" meals? I'm the only one who cooks in our house. It's just 4 of us, my husband, me and my daughter and little brother. My husband is 27 and I'm 25.

My husband barely knows how to make eggs, even though I've tried to talk to him constantly about learning how to cook. My daughter and brother are still in elementary school so they only help me cook.

The responsibility falls on me and it's honestly exhausting.. so, I just set up a system in my head. It's easy, for breakfast It's just something with eggs or cereal. Lunch is some sort of sandwich, burger, or leftovers. Dinner is the meal I usually plan but I have like 10 dishes I repeat. Sometimes I'll go off, especially Sunday, but generally I stay because it's easier for me mentally.

Well, one day I made just pasta alfredo with chicken and as we were eating, my husband mentions that it would be nice if I made ""fancier"" dishes. I asked him what he meant and he explained he wants me to change things up, add some more meat dishes and variety.

Next time, we went out shopping and i was putting ingredients I don't usually buy into the cart. As the ingredients started piling up, my husband was getting all puffy and upset. We got to the meat aisle and I started picking out beef and that's when my husband lost it and started taking things out of the cart. Saying that we can't afford my ""fancy living"". I blinked at him and tried to explain that he was the one who asked for variety and different dishes, so I'm buying different ingredients. 

He rolled his eyes and told me that I'm being dramatic. I just let him do his thing, taking out most of the ingredients out. 

The next week, I made the same dishes because that's all I had ingredients for. A week passed and my husband was all pouting that I made fried rice again and that he's sick of chicken. When I pointed out that he took out all the beef out of our cart, he blew up on me again and said I'm being an asshole because he doesn't know how to cook?

"AITA for blowing up at my sick husband when he asked for help with our toddler? I plan on sending this post to my husband once the verdict is in, whichever way it goes, so I’ll add as much of his perspective as I can.

Our toddler was sick through the weekend. I was up with him one night from 12:15-2:45, and off and on the next night. I probably got 10-12 hours of broken sleep the whole weekend.

Yesterday, my husband mentioned he was starting to feel a little sick. Last night I went to bed early hoping to catch up on rest. All throughout the night, my husband woke me up way more often than my toddler ever does, even on a bad night. Some of the times were not directly his fault, but other times I felt like he was being inconsiderate.

1: He snored loudly in my ear. 
2: He asked for another blanket because he had the chills. I told him it was at the foot of the bed. He asked for help and reminded me that he helps me when I’m sick, and that he’d still do the morning routine with our son.
3: He had a nightmare I had to shake him awake from. (normal)
4: He whispered at Alexa to ask for the time.
5: He asked for another blanket. I gave him mine.
6: He made a phone call (in bed) and left a full volume voicemail to his work to let them know he’d need to take a sick day.
7: At 5:30 in the morning, he woke me to ask if I could do the wake up routine with our son. (I do bedtime, he does wake up.)

At this point I blew up. I expressed how mad I was that he woke me up all night long, and now I have to wake up early to do what he said he’d still do, and I don’t get to stay home and catch up on sleep. He said I was in the wrong because marriage is in sickness and in health. I immediately got up to get ready. He said I didn’t have to start getting ready so early, I said yes I did because I start work at 7:30. I barely make it to work on time when I wake up at 6:00, and now I have to unexpectedly skip my shower, get my toddler ready, get his food ready for the day, feed him breakfast, drop him off at daycare, then take myself to work.

I said he was a grown man with a cold, and he robbed me of the rest I needed, and that I’ll be sleeping on the couch tonight. At that point I asked for space and we haven’t talked since. I was late for work which is a big deal at my job.

I might be the asshole for blowing up at my husband when he asked for support during an unexpected illness. Am I the asshole for being mad at my sick husband?

"AITA for telling a woman to charge a guy more at a yard sale. I was shopping around our city’s yard sales yesterday and stopped to look through some clothes. While I was looking a guy walked up and asked the old lady running the sale if she had anything golf related. My ears perked up because I have just recently gotten into golf. The lady said she had her late husband’s clubs but didn’t know what they would be worth so she dragged them out to show the guy. It was obvious the guy knew golf by the way he took a couple practice swings and you could tell by his car and clothing he appeared to be well off. As he looked around the bag the lady was telling him that her husband had just passed and that she didn’t know if the clubs were worth anything. He said they weren’t that great and offered $200 for everything. She seemed hesitant and said she didn’t know and he just kind of talked over her and said “here I’ll go grab the money” and walked towards his car. I walked over to see what was in the bag and for anyone who knows golf I’ll throw this out there.

Gently used mizuno Irons
Nice titlest wedges 
A very nice looking Scotty putter
Great condition titelist cart bag

This stuff combined would be a steal at 1k. 
Obviously this ladies late husband had spent a good penny on the clubs and I felt bad for her so I told her she should pass on that guys offer and have someone at a local course’s pro shop help her price the stuff out to sell if she wanted. She seemed totally shocked when I told her the driver and 3 wood were probably worth 800 alone. When the guy came back he was glaring at me and when he tried to hand the lady the cash she said no thanks and that she was going to get the stuff appraised. He got upset and told her she can’t back out of a deal so I chimed in that they didn’t really make a deal. He got pissed at me and told me I needed mind my business.

"AITA for asking why they ignored the no dog sign. I (33M) went to a coffee shop this past weekend.

"AITA for asking my sister in law what she's doing with her degree after she implied my university wasn't prestigious enough Last night my husband, our 2 year old daughter and I were at my in-laws. My sister-in-law and her husband and kids were there too. The topic of one of their cousin's kids going to university came up. We talked about how going to a good university helps in networking. I mentioned how I had gotten my first Business Analyst job because my interviewer had also gone to UofT. At this point my SIL chimed in with ""UofT Mississauga right? So not the actual one?""

My husband said politely that its the same thing and she just shrugged. I asked her where she went, she said she went to UofT and added St.George Campus. I then asked how she's using her degree (I knew shes a SAHM so thats why Im here that might have been an AH thing to say). She said she chose to be a SAHM mom and kind of stopped talking to me.

My husband thinks I was out of line. Admittedly I didn't think it through when I said it, just said what came to my mind. He says her question was tactless but not malicious. I said it was rude and thats what mattered. And the premise of it was just wrong. But I have been reconsidering it. She has texted him about how out of line I was. He's told her it was a misunderstanding between everyone and to let it go.

Update:

I was heartened by all the NTA votes. I read a lot of the comments and really appreciated those saying I wasn't the instigator so I was in the clear. As I read more comments and the way my SIL was being mentioned, it made me feel bad. I don't blame the comments they were only going by the context I had provided. But I took the fact that my SIL being criticized heavily was making me uneasy, as a cue to mend the relationship. She isnt a bad person, her and I aren't bffs but have always been cordial to each other.

The NTA verdict had given me the peace of mind that my reply wasn't totally uncalled for. So I asked my husband if she was still messaging him. He said she'd just sent a final wall of text of how hurt she was and then gone quiet. I asked him what he thought he said he'd told her that her remark was thoughtless. But told me that there's levels to this, my reply really cut her. I told him I was willing to apologize if she did too.

Last night I got a call from her. She said that she had realized that her comment about UTM had come across as insulting and that was not her intention. She said she was really proud of me and my career and the way I juggled it with being a mother and apologized for her remark. I thanked her and said my comment about her degree was out of line. That shes an awesome mother and my remark had zero thought behind it, it was just me saying whatever I could in the moment. She broke down a bit, and that honestly made me feel terrible. I teared up too and we just agreed to put this behind us.

"AITA for telling my friend that I was done inviting her to parties? I, (22-F) throw a lot of dinner parties (like a ton). I LOVE to cook, so I always put food on the table and I'm a pretty good chef I'd say. One of my friends comes to all of them. The problem is? She takes all the leftovers. Istg, every single time that there's a scrap left, she takes it. And I appreciate that she doesn't wanna waste food. That's not the problem. The problem is: I want some leftovers, too! So, I told her when we were eating this time, hey, ""don't take the leftovers, ok?"" And she was like, ""yeah, sounds good.""   
  
Fast forward to the end of party. She takes the god damn leftovers. When I notice later that night, I text her ""hey if you can't stop taking the leftovers, I'm not gonna invite you anymore."" She says ok.   
  
Next time that she comes over for a party, I remind her when we're eating, don't take the leftovers. She says okay. When she's about to leave, I was sitting near the table. Guess what I see: SHE'S TAKING THE LEFTOVERS. So I tell her that if she couldn't listen to a boundary I set, the clear consequence that I discussed with her was that she would not be invited to any more parties. She said that it wasn't fair that she couldn't have some, and she was only taking a bit this time. I'm not sure if that's true but I told her I didn't want her to take any. She says okay and puts them back.   
  
Fast forward to next time I hosted a party. She isn't invited. Apparently she found out through the grape vine (makes sense, we share quite a few friends) and she got pissed as hell, saying that she put them back and I should have invited her again. I think she might be right. Am I the Asshole?",Not the A-hole,1j8hml5
"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""? I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it. He seemed kind of shocked by her even asking this.

Did I go too far? My wife is mostly upset by our sil's comment about how I wasn't the one to give birth, as if it makes me less of their mother. Maybe I should have handled it better but I admit at the time I wasn't thinking very clearly.

"AITA for not changing my annual backyard party plans for my boyfriend and his kids? I (42F) have been hosting an end-of-summer party with my neighbors for years. It’s always the same setup: adults and kids come, we all celebrate together, and at some point the kids go to sleep while the adults continue the evening.

This year’s plan was the same: I was going to bring my kids (6 &amp; 10yo) inside to sleep at our home which is right next to the backyard. From the balcony there is both audio and visual access to the yard, and my kids also have a phone they can use to call me if needed. After putting them to bed I planned to go back to the backyard for a little while longer to enjoy the evening with friends.

I invited my boyfriend of 6 months (46M) and his kids (5 &amp; 7yo) to join us. He declined, saying he didn’t feel comfortable leaving his kids to sleep at my place since they hadn’t stayed there before. He also didn’t like the idea of putting them to bed at my place while he stayed outside with me, or going to bed with them while I stayed outside.

I told him I understood completely, and I didn’t have a problem with him choosing not to come. But then he got upset and said that he and his kids weren’t actually welcome at the party because of the way the party was set up. I explained that this party has been running for years with the same format, and it’s not really something I can or want to change for one guest. My view is that guests can decide if the event works for them, and if not, they don’t have to come. In his opinion I should have left the party with him and our kids when it was bedtime.

On top of that, during the party I didn’t have time to call him because I wanted to focus on my guests and enjoy the evening. He was very hurt by this too, saying I should have made time.

This all turned into a big argument. So: AITA for not changing the setup of a tradition (and for not calling during the party) to accommodate my boyfriend and his kids?",Not the A-hole,1n5gnbk
"AITA for avoiding my mom after she told me to ""suck it up"" when I broke my fingers I was at the gym where a heavy-weight fell onto three of the fingers on my left hand. I was in such severe pain that I thought I was going to pass out. While sobbing, I called my mom (as I am at college—far away from home). I told her that I thought I broke my finger/s, and that I wanted to go to urgent care. My mom has never been empathetic for physical injuries and mental health issues. When she heard me, she told me to suck it up and rest. 

I figured I would wait for a while—who knows, she could be right. 

edit: I feel I should mention that my fingers did not look deformed, so other than the bruising and swelling I was unsure if they were broken or not.

While waiting, my roommate came home and saw the state that I was in. She took one look at my hand and assured me we had to go to urgent care. I didn't want to betray my mom, because she always said to never go to the ER or urgent care due to our ""terrible insurance"". However, I went and researched the cost of an out-of-pocket X-ray at the nearest urgent care, and it was only $200, which I was willing to pay. I told my mom this, and she said, ""you better hope your fingers are broken or else I'm not helping you pay for anything"". 

So I was under a weird circumstance where I hoped my fingers were broken for the sake of saying ""I told you so"" to my mom.

I finally went to urgent care and got an X-ray. They confirmed both my pointer and middle fingers were broken, and may need surgery if not healed properly. 

When I called my mom back later that day and told her the news, she basically laughed and told me I should be glad that they were broken. 

Three weeks have gone by, and I have not spoken to her since. She's texted me and asked for updates on my fingers, but I feel conflicted on why she's suddenly acting like she cares when she clearly didn't in the first place. She's also not someone you can easily share your feelings with, so i'm not sure how to go about our next conversation. Should I just ignore it, or try to bring it up with her?

edit: I was not expecting the overflow of ""NTA"" comments, and I have gotten asked about why I believe I am the asshole. I spoke to my brother about it, and he told me that I was overreacting and that she just wants to check up on me, and probably feels bad for diminishing my issues. ",Not the A-hole,1is68j3
"AITA for sneaking out and causing my sister to lose her job? 
My sister is 33 (female), and I’m 14 (female). She had a baby three months ago.

I just got out of school for the summer and really wanted to rest, but my sister decided she wants to finally get a job. Now she’s making me babysit my niece. I have zero experience with babies, and I get overstimulated easily. It’s been really hard for me.

I asked her if she could put the baby in daycare or something, but she refused. I decided to just suck it up, but it’s been exhausting. I have insomnia, and it’s hard to sleep when I feel like I need to be awake 24/7 to watch the baby. I’m constantly scared something might happen if I fall asleep.

I told my mom how I felt, but she said I’d just have to deal with it. Both my parents work, so I’m left alone with the baby for hours almost every day.

A few days ago, I got tired of everything. The night before my sister got ready for work, I snuck out and went to my friend’s house so I wouldn’t have to deal with it and could finally get some sleep. When I came home that morning after I saw all the missed calls and messages and my mom and sister were really mad at me. They said I was being selfish and lazy.

(A little edit for more info- I see my dad being brought up a bit but he works in different places with steel work so he’s very rarely home but we do call often, my nieces father doesn’t want anything to do with her or my sister it’s been that way since she was pregant anyway so she left him and moved back in with us, she had a job before but quit to take care of the baby when she was a newborn and up until now of course, Also her and my mom work at the same place so they’re both night shift jobs and they’re tired when they come home from working so I usually have to watch my niece a bit longer so they can rest when they get home since they expect me to sleep while I’m babysitting but I just can’t I’m so paranoid something could happen, even when I’m feeding the baby and she coughs even a little or if she’s sleeping too hard I panic.

"AITA for asking my friend to leave my birthday party because she brought her crying baby? Sorry longish post

I (27F) recently threw a birthday party at my apartment. It was a pretty low-key gathering with about 10 friends, lots of snacks, a couple of drinks, and just a fun night hanging out. Everything was going fine until my friend, Sarah (28F), showed up with her 7-month-old baby.

Now, I love Sarah, and I know she’s a mom, but I wasn’t expecting her to bring the baby to a party, especially since we had planned to play games, drink, and chat. The baby started crying almost immediately when they walked in, and Sarah tried to calm her down, but she was clearly struggling. At first, I thought it was just a momentary thing, but the crying continued for almost an hour**.......**super loud and non-stop. It was hard to hear anything over the noise, and some of the other guests were getting visibly uncomfortable.I eventually pulled Sarah aside and asked her if she could maybe step outside with the baby or take a break in the other room until the baby calmed down. I explained that it was just hard to enjoy the party with the crying. She was clearly upset and told me that I “should be more understanding” since she can’t just leave the baby at home, and she was doing her best to keep her calm. She ended up leaving shortly after, and now she’s not speaking to me.

I warned her about it all, saying, ""ohh, best taking your sunglasses off your head, he'll grab them. "" Now these are Gucci sunglasses costing almost 800 pounds ( which to me is a crazy amount for sunglasses, but each to ther own), she rolled her eyes at me, and accused me of hogging my own baby 🤷‍♀️.

So she stood holding him. Took her phone out wanting to take a selfie, which again I am fine with as long as it's not posted ( dont want a pic of him online as of yet.) He, of course, grabbed her sunglasses, got excited as he got them, waved his hands about the sunglasses, and they flew. She screamed, scaring him. He panicked and flailed, hitting her iPhone to the floor. I quickly took him as she was freaking out.

She says I need to buy her a new iPhone 16 and replace her sunglasses, or give her the money for them, which is £2300.

I said, ""we can't pay that as that's not even my monthly wage. Plus, I am on maternity, but also I dont feel like I should, as you ignored my warnings.

"AITA for accepting cake at my friend's birthday party? So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.

Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, ""Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?"" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.

"AITA for locking the bedroom door when my husband works? I work first shift and my husband works second shift. Because of that, I often spend nights alone. He gets home around 2am. 

I lock the bedroom door when I am home and he is working. I would hear noises and be not sure what it was, and I got tired of checking. It was usually my cats or an appliance. But I got tired of checking. So I lock the door so if I hear a noise, I know it’s the cats or an appliance and if not, I have a locked barrier between me and whatever it could be. And when I go to sleep, I unlock the bedroom door so he can get in. 

Last night he came hours early. He was cut from work because it was extra slow. I didn’t hear him come in through the front door because I had the TV and air conditioner on. If I did hear him, I always go out to say hi and I unlock the door as I do. But I didn’t hear him so I couldn’t. He tried to get in and found the door locked. It took me a few seconds to pause the TV and get my cat off of me and get up to unlock the door.

"AITA for snapping when someone rubbed my belly and implied I might be pregnant? So today, my office building was throwing a little fiesta-themed event and they offered free lunch in the cafeteria. A bunch of us went down to grab food.

While I was standing in line, I opened the Nest camera app to check on something and saw a little bird that’s been showing up outside every day. I laughed and casually said to no one in particular, “This bird comes to visit me every day.”

Right after I said that, a coworker (who has made pregnancy comments toward me before) came up, rubbed my belly without asking, and said something like, “Maybe it’s because you’ve got a baby bird on the way.”

I felt this immediate wave of rage—like why are we still doing this in 2025?? So I said, “Don’t be wishing that kind of bad luck on me.”

She looked super taken aback, and my boss (who overheard) also looked at me like I’d just said something offensive. It felt like I was the crazy one for being upset. But I didn’t ask to be touched, I’m not pregnant, and I really don’t like people making those kinds of comments about my body.

"AITA for asking for my dead sisters  ring back after my brother used it to propose my sister died when i was like 6 and she was 17. we weren’t super close or anything but i still remember little bits of her. her laugh, how she always painted her nails, her posters. she was like this perfect angel to my mum after she passed. i barely remember the funeral.

when i was like 12 i found this old ring in her stuff. nothing fancy, just a silver ring w a small stone. it fit me and idk why but i kept it. it wasn’t some big dramatic thing, i didn’t steal it or anything, i just… took it and started keeping it. i didn’t wear it loads or flaunt it, just had it in this little box and sometimes i’d look at it when i missed her. it kinda became this one thing that felt like mine, like my piece of her

so anyway last weekend we had this family lunch and my brother (27m) brings his gf who everyone knew he was gonna propose to. and yeah, he stands up, does the big speech and pulls out THE ring. my sister’s ring. the one i’ve kept for like 7 years

i literally froze. his gf starts crying, ppl are clapping, i’m just sat there like wtf. i look at my mum and she just smiles at me like nothing happened. after dinner i ask her was that the ring and she’s like yeah, your brother asked me and dad and we said it was fine. she said it was sweet and symbolic and my sister would’ve wanted it passed down or whatever

and i was like ??? it was never yours to give tho??? like i’ve had it for years?? and she just goes oh come on it’s just a ring don’t be dramatic. but like when i had it it wasn’t “just a ring”

so yeah i kinda snapped. waited till ppl were outside and told my brother i wanted it back. he laughed at first then was like no wtf and i said ok well then i’ll tell your gf where it came from and let her decide. he got mad said i was ruining his proposal and making it about me like always. my mum dragged me into the kitchen saying everyone noticed i wasn’t happy and that i left halfway thru dinner. yeah bc i was crying in the bathroom like ????

dad tried to calm it down but my brother kept going on about how selfish i was and that i’d been weird about my sister for years. i didn’t even say anything i just left early and haven’t spoken to any of them since. mum rang me yesterday saying have i calmed down and am i ready to say sorry and i said not really and she hung up

my cousin texted me later saying it was actually super messed up and she doesn’t blame me but idk. i probably could’ve handled it better but i just felt so blindsided. it’s not even about the stupid ring it’s just like. they acted like it didn’t matter to me. like i didn’t matter

"AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage? A few months ago me (28f) and my sister “Eva” (33f) realized that we were both pregnant (I’d say she was about 6 weeks further than I was). She’s been struggling with infertility, so we were all happy for her. I have an older son (2m) with my husband (32m). 

Sadly, a couple weeks ago I lost my baby. We told my family. They were all supportive, but I did sort of pull away from them. They would’ve tried to avoid discussing Eva’s baby around me, but I didn’t want to overshadow her, especially since she’s wanted this for a long time. I also didn’t want to be reminded of my own loss whenever I saw her.

So I haven’t been to my parents’ place for Sunday dinner since or really spent time with Eva, which we had been doing a lot before. I replied vaguely to any messages about my absence, wasn’t the best communication from me.

Yesterday my parents were hosting family dinner for my dad’s birthday. I’d been thinking about going because I missed my family, and while of course the pain of losing my child has not faded, I’m at a point where I can at least put it a little to the side to be there for my sister and my new niece (when she is born). 

So I let my family know that we would be coming. However, we had to get a gift for my dad and then my son had a bit of a tantrum, so we got to my parents’ place about an hour late. I wished my dad and then went to the kitchen, where my mom, Eva, and my SILs were.

But before I went in, I heard them say my name so I stopped. My mom was saying something like “Well I guess [OP]’s not coming” and Eva said “What did you expect, she probably changed her mind and is just staying home again. Honestly, I’m sorry for her but you would think she was the first woman to ever lose a kid. And it’s not even her first kid.” They then kept talking about other things, but I just wanted to leave. 

I went and got my husband, who was with my BIL, dad, and brothers in the living room. I told my dad I was really sorry but we needed to go. They all protested, but my husband could see how upset I was so he didn’t. We got my son and left. 

When we got home, I just kind of cried for a while. My husband asked me what happened and I told him. He was angry that she said that, but thought we shouldn’t have abruptly left because my dad had been looking forward to seeing us, and my son missed his cousins.

After this, I was feeling conflicted. Later my brother texted me saying my dad had been really upset about us leaving and brought it up at dinner, which caused a whole fight because mom and Eva realized that I must’ve heard them talking, and my dad was mad about it. My brother said that it was pretty bad and he wished I had just stayed so none of it would’ve happened, obviously Eva didn’t mean for me to hear that, they were all just frustrated that I’d been AWOL for so long. 

Now I feel bad, because I didn’t mean to ruin dinner. Obviously what Eva said was hurtful, but I can see how my actions might have led to her saying something out of anger, and I could’ve talked to her about it later instead of just leaving. Idk, AITA?


ETA for additional context:

- My family is the type to just drop by at each other’s places and see one other multiple times throughout the week besides just Sunday dinner. Lately I’ve been kind of fielding off any requests for people to visit. I just want to I guess emphasize how close my family is and how abnormal it is for me to not be seeing them regularly even for a little bit. I haven’t been ghosting them, but I just text them saying “I’m not feeling up to it” for dinner and kind of leave it there.

- My sister and my mom have always been closer to each other, as have me and my dad. Additionally, my brothers are closer to her since they’re all closer in age.

- I mentioned this in a comment, but we didn’t text anyone saying we were going to be late since my family is usually pretty lax about time (me and my husband usually show up early though so it’s unusual for us to be late and might’ve been why they thought we weren’t coming). Also my son was continuing to be a handful all the way there so that kept us busy and we kind of didn’t think about notifying anyone.

- I’ve started looking into grief counseling, now that I feel like I can at least talk about it.

- As far as she’s told us, my sister hasn’t had a miscarriage before, she just had trouble getting pregnant to begin with.

- From what my brother told me, my sister and mom didn’t admit to saying anything, they just kind of looked at each other once my dad mentioned me leaving, and he noticed and asked about it. Then one of my SILs who was also in the kitchen (my other brother’s wife) mentioned what they said and my dad got mad. My other brother was also apparently angry with them and it just turned into my mom and sister trying to defend themselves, my dad and other brother yelling, and my brother (who texted me) trying to stay out of it.

"AITA for asking my boyfriend's mom to call me by my actual name? I (30M) have a name that, in English-speaking countries, is usually a gender-neutral nickname (think Alex, Charlie, Frankie etc). I am half Asian, and in the country of my name's origin, it's a unisex name that isn't short for anything.

Since I first met my boyfriend's (46M) mom (70sF), she has repeatedly asked what my name is short for. I've told her it isn't short for anything and different languages just have different naming conventions, but she keeps asking anyway. She also makes other related comments that make me uncomfortable - asking where I'm ""really"" from; that it doesn't make sense for me to have a name from Country A if I'm ""really"" from Country B; that she hates the trend among young people of having gender-neutral names and I must have a ""proper"" name she can call me. I've talked to my boyfriend about it, and he says he gets why it's uncomfortable, but doesn't want to bring it up because she wouldn't understand. I've started clarifying what my name is and asking to leave it at that, because I'm sick of answering the same questions every time.

Last time we saw her, she greeted me by calling me a ""long version"" of my name (eg Alexis instead of Alex). I didn't say anything but my boyfriend laughed, assuming it was a joke. However, she continued to refer to me by this name, despite mine and my boyfriend's corrections, until I eventually snapped at her to stop. I'm usually polite in trying to divert these kinds of comments, but being referred to by a Western name really pissed me off, and I said something like, ""Can you stop this bullshit with my name please, I've had enough of it now and it's fucking racist.""

She got really upset, saying she couldn't believe I would speak to her like that. I left the table, and my boyfriend shouted after me to come back and apologize, but I went outside to calm down. Eventually, my boyfriend came outside to tell me to apologize for swearing and calling her racist. I said I would apologize for swearing, because I shouldn't have been disrespectful, but I wasn't going to apologize for calling what she said racist. He said she doesn't see it as a race thing and she just finds my name a little funny, so I told him to forget it, I was going to drive home and he could get an Uber by himself.

I left by myself and he came home later. I apologized for leaving without him, and he said he understands why I was upset, but I need to apologize to his mom because she's really hurt that I called her a racist. I said I hadn't called her a racist, and that I wanted to apologize for swearing, but didn't want to apologize for saying that what she said was racist, because then she'll just keep doing it. However, I'm worried I'm wrong to be so stubborn, because my distinction between saying something racist/being a racist feels kind of pedantic, and because she keeps phoning my boyfriend to tell him he shouldn't allow me to talk to his own mother like that.

"AITA for not letting my niece sew me a dress for a big career moment because she doesn’t do a good job? I love my niece, and I support her creative expression. I’ve told her that she could make me a dress for running around the house, running errands, hanging out, etc. I’m happy to wear something she’s made at times where it’s appropriate. I’ve worn the acrylic scarf she crocheted me for a few years now and it’s not because it looks good.

She uses youtube and tiktok tutorials, so she doesn’t know how to work off patterns, make tailoring adjustments, choose the right fabric, etc. On tiktok and other social media spaces the “cool” thing to do is announce that you made your garment from a ratty thrifted sheet using an old pair of shorts you had lying around. Sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't. But she doesn’t take the time to do things like pressing or finishing steams, trimming or sewing in ends, etc. When I’ve suggested it to her, she said it’s more authentic the way she does it.

She begged me to do an outfit for an event I have coming up where I’ll be on stage. I tried to let her down gently and said that I had a dress being tailored as we speak. She said I could wear that one to something else, but that I should wear something she made because it would be special and a bonding experience for us. Everyone in my family is obsessed with “bonding experiences.” Everything has to be a bonding experience between the adults and kids. It’s exhausting.  I reiterated my no, saying “No, I do not want you to make me anything.” 

Her mom (my sister in law) is telling me that I care way too much about my appearance and my image. This is an event related to my career. The last thing I need to do is walk up on stage in something that doesn’t fit, or looks like it was made with a sheet. And especially because I am plus sized, how I look is judged more harshly.

SIL complaining about me being superficial is not new. I dared to buy ONE designer bag for myself and she did the whole thing you see on Reels, the whole “STUPID! I would just thrift a bag and put the rest of my money IN the bag!” bit. I was briefly engaged and she would not shut up about how I supposedly wanted a wedding, not a marriage because I dared to want to pick out my own decor and not just use whatever she could scrounge up on Marketplace or get for sale at the craft store.

My career is the most important thing in the world to me right now. Obviously for my SIL, her child is the most important thing in the world to her. But am I correct to put my career ahead of her child’s feelings, or do my values automatically make me the asshole?",Not the A-hole,1lq038o
"AITAH for refusing to drive if my wife is in the car? For years, after we got married, I could never figure out why I would be so angry and moody anytime my wife and I went somewhere.  Then it finally clicked.  I was only in a bad mood if I drove with my wife.  My wife is the absolute worst back seat driver I have ever seen.

Doesn't matter how I drive, she still finds things to complain about.
 
Why did you go this way?  If you would of went that way we would be there by now!

You're driving too fast!
You're driving too slow!
You could of made that light unfuckingreal!

There were 17 great parking spots and you had to choose parking spot 18 which is the absolute worst!  

You turned your blinker on too late!
You turned your blinker on too early!
Why are you accelerating so slowly?
Whoa!  Was it necessary to accerlate that quickly?  Etc...

So for the past couple of years, I have refused to drive.  I now make her do all the driving.  And lo and behold, I'm no longer a grumpy person when we travel.  

 She has now gotten upset that she now is always driving and told me I needed to atleast split driving 50/50 with her.  I told her if she could keep her opinions to her self while I was driving then I would.  She agreed.  So Last weekend I started driving.  She couldn't even last 3 minutes without criticizing my driving.  I pulled over and told her I'm done.  Either she takes over driving or we're going home.  She eventually took the wheel.

"AITA for declining to invite a woman who has called herself ‘a total klepto’ into my home? I joined a Women’s Social Club 6 months ago because I’ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often.

I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I’ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she’s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem “cool” to the other people in the group.

I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we’d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come.

Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn’t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying “I thought we got along” which yes, is true. 

I told her I’m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I’ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it. 

She said ‘Okay’ very quietly. She then said “You’re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don’t even know anything about me.” 

I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is.

This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I’m out of touch and take things too literally. Am I?",Not the A-hole,1i6u3os
"AITA for not disclosing my medical history to a stranger? I (F27) am an amputee. Ever since my amputation, countless people have asked me what happened to me. At first I wasn’t bothered by it and sometimes would poke fun saying a shark bit it off or some other random story. 

However, as time progressed it began to upset me more and more. I would get stopped in the middle of a parking lot, stopped in a busy aisle of the store, stopped on my way to and from appointments, etc. The part that bothered me the most is that they didn’t even have the decency to introduce themselves, make small talk, or even ask me my name first. Children are actually infinitely more respectful than these grown ass adults. 

One morning, I was outside a hotel I was in smoking. This lady came outside and immediately asked “What did you do to lose your leg?” Mind you, it was like literally 6am. I said (verbatim): “You haven’t said good morning, hello, or even asked me my name and yet you feel entitled to my medical history? Would you like that to happen to you?”

She started cussing me out and said that I was rude and a cunt etc. 

AITAH for saying this and feeling that was out of line?

"AITAH for kicking my houseguests out 11 hours before their flight is scheduled to leave? My friend and his wife have made plans to visit us this summer for a weekend stay. The flight is two hours, so not a really long journey for them. 

We have our home professionally cleaned regularly and go all in to be good hosts to our guests. However, with any good thing, some people try to take advantage. 

I usually will take an extra day from work after guests leave to get rest or even tidy up the house a bit. It’s just a peaceful time for me to return to the normalcy of our household after being in host mode. Before my friend booked his flight, my husband let it slip that I will not be working the Monday after my friends’ stay with us. Next thing I know, my friend tells me that they will be flying out on a red eye the Monday I  took off for rest. This means they will arrive early Friday morning, and leave late Monday night. To that I responded that I will be taking them to the airport as early as 8am Monday morning so I can have my day of rest like I planned. 

My friend tells me that he doesn’t understand why they can’t just hang out at our place or have us show them around town more on that Monday since they have a late flight. I explained to them that the day off is for me to rest, not to continue to be their host. I told them that they are more than welcome to leave their luggage here if they want to go explore on their own, but we will not be hosting them or playing tour guide after Monday morning. 

He goes on to admit that it was cheaper for him to book the later flight on Monday and that it’s not a big deal for him and his wife to just hang out at my house all day until it’s time for them to fly out. Keep in mind that I will have to take them to the airport or pay for rideshare because he refuses to pay.  I will also have to feed them. 

I told him that they are welcome to visit and stay with us, but staying at our house all day Monday is not an option and he needs to make other arrangements. He’s now accusing me of being a horrible friend and his wife says we’re AHs. Your thoughts? ",Not the A-hole,1k0hdqq
"AITA for telling my roommate I won’t be changing my habits because of him bringing his friends over? I (23m) rent a house with four of my buddies from college. We have done this for two years. It helps that not only are we great friends, but we have a system of deciding house rules: a majority vote. Disagreements on cleaning?  Majority vote.  When to make quiet hours for the night on weeknights?  Majority rules. It has kept everything flowing smoothly. 

Anyway one of my friends moved out last month to get a place with his girlfriend. He found a friend of a friend to take over his room. The guy was nice enough but then he came to us with a “declaration.”  

Apparently he was uncomfortable that we’re not always completely dressed in the house. No one is a nudist, but some of will sometimes not wear a shirt or just be in pajamas or boxers or underwear when lounging around the house. I admittedly am one of the two of us that does it the most, as I usually just lounge around in boxers or other underwear. We all met each other through a sport so we’re comfortable seeing each other like that. 

Anyway I guess the new guy was caught off guard because he asked if we could constitute a clothing on rule in the house. As usual we did a vote and the rest of us thought it was unnecessary. So there was no rule, but I did start wearing clothes more though there were some times I didn’t bother (when I just woke up, after showering, when I was just coming out to my room for something, etc.). Just to be considerate. 

Apparently not enough. I noticed that even though we always all gave notice before people coming over he stopped doing so. I found myself a few times just in my underwear when he rolls in with a crew.  Got a couple of weird looks, but I just excuse myself and get dressed. I told him once if he gave me a heads up I’d be dressed before they got there, but he just rolled his eyes. One of my other housemates has also run into this issue. 

Anyway the other day he came to me and my other housemate and asked if his plan to shame us for never wearing clothes worked. We looked at him weird and he said that he was purposely trying to embarrass us by having people see us. We said we’re not embarrassed (we work out for a reason) and weren’t going to change his habit. He stormed off and started smack talking us to the other roommates. AITA?",Not the A-hole,1phfq3e
"AITA for reminding my dad he didn’t pay child support?  Growing up I never really knew my dad. He was in and out of the picture and later years him and my mom would argue over his jail time for not paying child support. My mom died and I live in her house with my girlfriend and her child. 

In my adult life my relationship has been the same with my dad. He reached out after my mom’s death but he never really made the effort and it always felt that if he tried to have a relationship with me it was always for a new girlfriend or wife benefit not mine. 

My dad recently had a bed wreck and his apartment only had stairs. Him and his new wife acted like they will move into my home since it’s an old school ranch house. All one floor. 

I told him no. He asked my why I didn’t trust him and he would pay rent. I told him why would I trust him to pay rent when he never paid my mom child support for years. 

His wife told me that was a rude thing to say.  I told maybe my they should ask one of her kids (she has 5) or one of my dad’s 3 other kids because of 1 of 9 I’m not stepping up to help because my dad has never helped me.

My dad said he would grab certain things to help me out and i said okay. I gave him a list. I really needed chicken thighs and blocks of cheese. He came home with ground chicken and only mozzarella cheese thats pre shredded. 

I told my mom about it because this isn’t the first time hes done this and its made me upset. 
She got mad at me for being upset with him because we never ask him for anything. I have asked him multiple times to get things for me and he either gets the wrong thing, doesn’t get anything i need or complains. 

For example, i wanted to go shopping before my wisdom tooth removal. I had a list of things with pictures because he said he could grab it and certain brands make me sick.
He got 4/20 things on the list and said everything else was not necessary. He went with my money and said that.

Now my moms upset with me because she is in debt from always buying stuff for the house. But the whole reason that’s happened is because of my dads weaponized incompetence.
So am i the Asshole for being mad at me dad and telling my mom?

We’ve been close since college but lately it feels like I’m just... aesthetic filler to her. She picked her bridal party dresses without asking for input and they’re tight. Like SKIMS-meets-sausage-casing tight. I'm a size 16. The other girls are size 2–6. I asked if there were other options and she laughed and said, “Nooo I love how it looks with all different body types, like it’s giving real women.”

Excuse me?

I asked her straight up if she just wanted me there as some token diversity of size and she got quiet, then hit me with the “You’re so confident, though! That’s why I wanted you in it!” Which is honestly code for “you make me look better.”

I told her I’m not comfortable being someone’s walking body positivity prop, and maybe she should get one of her influencer friends instead. She cried, told me I was ruining her vision, and now the group chat is weirdly quiet.

"AITA for requesting to remove my thesis partner from our research, which may cause her not to graduate? So I (M) am in a college course with only 8 people, so we’re all pretty close. For our thesis, we were assigned to work in pairs and I got partnered with a woman I’ve already worked with several school projects before. She tends to do things last-minute, but she usually does them, so I wasn’t thrilled but figured we’d manage.

That changed quickly.

We both work night shifts, but she also has a kid. I get that, and I’ve really tried to be understanding. But I still managed to interview her three times over three months, while she was constantly unavailable. When it came time to transcribe the interviews (each an hour long), we split the work, but she didn’t do any of hers. I ended up doing all of it just to keep us from falling behind.

Then came encoding, which is the most tedious and time-consuming part of our paper. We split the work again, and for almost a month, I kept bugging her and messaging her to finish her part, and she never did. I eventually gave up and just did the whole thing myself. I told our advisor, and they made her pay for the subscription to the software we were using as compensation. But that was the only thing she contributed.

Still trying to be fair, I asked her to handle our thesis defense presentation and script instead. But on the day of the defense, the presentation was unfinished, and I had to fix it myself right there in the room. She arrived 1.5 hours late, and the script she gave only covered 20 pages for a 45+ slide deck.

After the defense, we were told to redo the encoding and rewrite chapters 3 and 4 separately so we could compare and combine. I started mine right away. She? Still hasn’t done anything. I’ve been consistently messaging her to ask for updates, to follow up on her encoding, her write-up and I just got “yeah I’ll do it” but still nothing. And I constantly see her active on Facebook and posting stories.

Finally, I asked our advisor if I could submit the thesis under my name only, which would mean she won’t graduate . Now people are telling me I’m being too harsh and should just carry her one last time, but I honestly feel like I’ve carried her through the entire thing already.

"AITAH for telling my parents that they neglected me because of my brothers illness? So I'm a 16 year old girl and I have an older brother who is 20 and he moved out about 2 months ago.

My brother has misophonia. I don't know everything about the illness and I dont wanna say anything wrong, but its basically being triggered by certain sounds. He was diagnosed at 7 when I was 4 and he has a very strong version of the illness I think.

Me and my brother used to get along ok, but it got worse after that. Funnily enough all of his triggers were connected to me. My laughing, my walking, my eating, everything seemed to trigger him. I remember my father yelling at me when I was like 6, because I laughed while my brother was also in the car. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with them, my parents would eat with him and when he was finished he could leave and then I could get my food. I didn't even really understand what was going on, because I was a little kid.

I was often alone, because I couldn't go anywhere with them and would trigger him and when we did something together it didn't feel the same, because even alone, I was always scared to do something wrong and get yelled at. Even in school I would barely talk or laugh.

I was never very close with my family and spend most time alone in my room or with friends outside.

Since my brother moved out my parents are trying to get me to connect with them more. This morning my mom asked me if I wanted to go see a movie with her and I was already in a bad mood, because I was stressed due to exams, so I sorta just snapped and told her I didn't want to and to stop trying to fix things with me, because it was ruined and that she couldn't fix the neglect they put me through simply by watching a movie with me. She then yelled back at me and told me to stop being jealous of my brother and that they were doing the best they could and that they didn't wanna neglect me and just tried to take care of my brother.

I just left after that and both my parents have been ignoring me all day and now I feel kinda bad, I still rlly love them

EDIT UPDATE: So I dont know how many people are still gonna see this considering its probably not shown on the main page anymore, but I wanna provide at least a little update here. Many people suggested I show this post and the comments to my parents and I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do, considering the whole situation in general, but I did do it a few hours ago and it didn't go too well. They went on a rant about how people on the internet dont know anything about me and our family (which is true obviously, but still idk what that adds to the situation considering they know everything I wrote in my post is true) and that I should stop believing what people tell me on the internet, because all they want it drama and they dont care about me.

"AITA for not saying thank you when a parent returned my son's lunch box I (35F) have a son (4M), let's call him Ben. I pack lunch for all my kids and purchased Bento lunch boxes for each of them. They go for about $50 on Amazon. I label my kids lunches, lunch box, as well as pretty much everything they own and take to school. A few weeks ago when I went to pick up my son from school on a Tuesday, I noticed that his book bag was a little light, and when I looked inside I realized that he was missing his Bento box. No biggie - I mentioned it to one of the after school teachers and she said that she had accidentally sent it home with another kid (he has a similar name to my son - let's say Ken). I should note that I have never met this kid or his parent.

Any way, again, no biggie, I just kindly asked her have the parent return the lunch box the next day. The following day I inquired about the lunch box and the teacher said that the parent had messaged her saying she would bring it the following day as they are PT students coming on T/Th. Alright cool. Thursday comes around and after school I'm like okay, where's my son's lunch box. The teacher tells me the parent forgot it but will def bring it next Tues. I'm a little annoyed, but I figure I'll give the parent some grace. Next Tue comes, and no lunch box. At this point, I'm properly annoyed. I mention the missing lunch box to my son's daytime teachers. Asking them to reach out to this parent so I can get my son's lunch box back because wtf.

Fast forward to another WEEK. Still no lunch box. Apparently the mother is postpartum and very forgetful. She made a joke to the teacher saying the lunch box was getting closer to school because she put it by her front door. Needless to say, I'm properly pissed. I really don't understand why this is such an ordeal...just put the lunch box in your car or your kid's book bag to bring to school. My husband wants me to find the parent and confront her myself, but the teachers won't give me her name, and I can never catch the kid or her at pick up. Sooo I send a very stern email to the principal, admin, and all my son's teachers expressing my frustration with this and explaining that I want my kid's stuff. I guess they FINALLY are able to get through to this parent and the next Thursday (nearly 4 WEEKS later), she meets me and brings the lunch box. She apologizes and she tried to joke about the situation, but I was so annoyed that I just kind of stared at her blankly. Then I just said okay, took the lunch box and left. She apparently told some of the other parents that I was rude to her and that I could have been more APPRECIATIVE that she brought the lunch box back. Ma'am...(eyeroll). So anyway, AITA for not saying thank you?

  
EDIT: Soooo last Friday we had a Halloween parade at the kids school and a lot of the parents were there. One of the parents who heard about the “hostage lunchbox,” was chatting me up and I was explaining the situation, and for those of you who said she wanted it for herself - spot on. Apparently her son really liked it and was always telling his mom for it, but she didn’t want to get it for him. When it was mistakenly put in her son’s bag, she thought it was the perfect opportunity to just keep it. She thought I would just let it go and she would be able to keep it for her son. But no dice on that. Circling back to the folks who were talking about the price of the lunchbox — it’s BECAUSE it’s expensive that I wanted it back. I’m not made of money and I buy quality stuff for my kids so they can last throughout the school year and beyond, so for me to just “let it go,” and then have to spend money to purchase another one wasn’t going to happen. Plus I really did feel like she was playing games with me. Anywho, I’ll admit that I wasn’t the nicest when she returned it (I'm only human), but when I saw her at the parade I made sure I was polite-ish and showed her the link if she wanted to get the lunchbox for her kid as well as mentioned that there were some less expensive options. All's well that ends well.",Not the A-hole,1ol30a8
"AITA for not attending my family Christmas gathering because I can’t afford the $250 white elephant gift? My (29F) family has a tradition where we do a big Christmas get-together every year, and the highlight is the white elephant gift exchange. It’s always been a fun time, but this year my family decided to raise the price limit to $250 per gift.

I’m honestly a little shocked. I get that inflation has hit, but that’s a lot of money for one gift, especially for something that’s supposed to be fun and quirky, not something super expensive or meaningful. I have a pretty tight budget this year with unexpected medical bills, and just general life expenses. After paying for all my bills and essentials, there’s barely enough left to get by. The idea of spending $250 on a gift is totally unrealistic for me. xpected to show up for the family dinner and festivities.

I started feeling like I was being pushed out of the tradition because of my financial situation. I told her that, honestly, if I can’t participate in the gift exchange, then I might not come at all. I didn’t want to be the person who has to sit awkwardly and watch everyone else exchange expensive gifts when I couldn’t contribute. Plus, I didn’t want to feel embarrassed about not meeting their expectations.. My mom thinks I’m being “petty” and that it’s “just one gift.” My dad says I’m overreacting and that it’s not about the price, it’s about the spirit of Christmas (which, to be fair, I do agree with, but still—$250??). Some of my siblings are saying I should just suck it up and “join in” because it’s about being together, while others are telling me they agree with me but are still going to participate since the majority of the family agreed to this.

 There’s approximately 18-25 people in my family that will be there, and we are still expected to get gifts for our family members as well. I really don’t want to make a big scene or cause drama, but at the same time, I feel like this is a massive financial burden that’s being placed on me, and I just don’t know if it’s worth it to show up and feel out of place…

So, aita if I decide to sit this one out? 

Edit: to clarify $250 is the amount my family “agreed” to when it comes to the cost of the gift. I don’t even think a maximum amount was discussed. ",Not the A-hole,1hgygoz
"AITA for telling my SIL to get over herself and stop trying to one up us Throwaway account. My (29M) wife (27F) and her sister (30F) got pregnant around the same time. The babies are the first of a new generation on their side of the family so everyone was excited. SIL was further along, but my wife ended up giving birth on week 32, plus she had some complications that had her hospitalized. My nephew was born 2 weeks later at full term.

Apparently SIL was resenting ""having her thunder stolen"" and felt like she and her new baby weren't getting enough attention. She keeps making these comments like she's trying to one-up us. First she was saying how sorry she was that my wife missed the ""golden hour"" because they had to take our son to the NICU. This upset my wife since during her hospitalization she was often too sick to visit the NICU and she's already feeling crappy about missing skin-to-skin on those first few weeks.

After we started to bring our son to family gatherings SIL started comparing the boys. Saying how much bigger and more alert her son looks like compared to ours and how he hit more milestones.

Last weekend we had lunch at my in laws'. My wife and I were excited to tell everyone that our son laughed for the first time earlier that day (he's 5.5 months old, 3.5 corrected). MIL and FIL were having a good time watching the video when SIL made another comment about how HER son did that a month ago. I don't know why that was the last straw, but I just about had it. I told SIL that she's pathetic for trying to one-up a freaking baby. That her full term son wasn't special for being more developed than a preemie. That she should get the f*** over not giving birth to the first grandbaby.

Needless to say this ruined lunch and my wife's family is pissed. I admit I was harsh with my words and tone and this was the first time I confronted her family like this. Up until now we'd each handle our own relatives. But these comments upset my wife and pissed me off. So AITA for being so harsh and not staying in ""my"" lane?",Not the A-hole,1ik31ah
"AITA for leaving my mother's party after she insulted my daughter? I (36F) have a stepdaughter (14F), ""Anna"".

Her father and I married when Anna was two. I consider her to be my real daughter in every way that matters, and love her just as much as my biological children.

Most of my family adores Anna, she's a very sweet and hardworking girl who does her best to make them proud. However, my mother (55F) appears to not. She's never outright said that she dislikes my daughter or why, but I've always thought it's because Anna wasn't my biological child.

I've been teaching Anna to cook for a few years now. She asked me last year if she could start bringing her cooking to family gatherings and potlucks, and of course I agreed.

My mother started critiquing Anna's dishes. It began with just suggesting she add different spices or cook an ingredient a little longer, but over the past few months it's been getting worse. She doesn't criticize the dishes of any family members.

This Thanksgiving, she told Anna that the casserole she made was disgusting and inedible. I told my mother to stop criticizing Anna and that she was doing her best, but she just brushed me off, which was the final straw.

My family was in town this week to celebrate my mother's birthday. I had some curry that my mother had made about six months ago and given to me to freeze, so I reheated it and brought it to the party, and told everyone Anna had worked very hard to make it just like her grandmother always did.

Immediately, my mother started criticizing the curry, saying how Anna had added too much spice and overcooked the chicken. She even went so far as to tell Anna that she should stop bringing food to potlucks altogether.

I hadn't originally intended to make a big deal out of this, but that comment crossed a line. I informed my mother that it was her own curry that I had reheated, and Anna had not actually cooked it.

She immediately started sputtering and backpedaled, saying she was just trying to give constructive criticism and make Anna a better cook, but I knew she didn't really believe it. I asked her why she would treat my own stepdaughter so badly, and she admitted that she didn't see Anna as her real grandchild.

This was the final straw for me. I found my husband, Anna, and my other children, and told them we had to leave, explaining what my mother said. We probably won't be attending any family gatherings for the forseeable future either.

My mother has gone full scorched-earth on facebook and most family members have taken her side. She says that I ruined her party by leaving, and that I destroyed our relationship for someone who isn't even my ""real"" child. My husband is on my side, but he thinks that we shouldn't have left the party, since I'd already proven my point.",Not the A-hole,1ht9y9g
"AITA - Do not want a service dog to participate in my wedding. Throwaway

I'm (28F) am getting married in the spring.  I've asked one of my best friends to be one of my bridesmaids.  She has a service dog for PTSD.  I respect her dog and glad she has it in her life.  My Fiance and I don't particularly care for dogs, and we've decided we don't want her service dog in our photos or in the ceremony.  

When I asked her she got excited and immediately said her dog could wear something to match the rest of the bridesmaids.  Thats when I explained that the dog could come to the wedding, but wouldn't be an active participant in the day.  We don't want it in photos or in the ceremony.  It could go to photos, but not be in them.  It'll be off to the side for the 10-15 minute ceremony.  In preliminary discussions with our photographer we've brought this up. 

She did not take it well.  Called me an asshole and ableist and it was not a constructive conversation after the ask.  She hasn't accepted my offer to be a bridesmaid, but also hasn't declined formally.  AITA?  ",Not the A-hole,1n2odkk
"AITA for telling a friend exactly why my wife and I wouldn't go on a trip with her. My wife and I (both 32, both F) have a friend named Anna (33). Anna is so sweet, very funny and can also be very naive. While this isn't *always* a bad thing, she is at times ignorant of how the world works/news etc. 

Anna has family that owns a large vacation property in another country. She's long wanted to take a friends trip there, and is finally planning on doing so. Multiple people have been invited, and this past weekend when she and I got coffee, my wife and I were invited. 

The problem is, homosexuality is criminalized in this country. In case you missed it, I am a woman married to a woman and I would not feel safe traveling there. I would especially be worried about my wife- she has a very classic ""butch"" look whereas I am more feminine. I know a lot of times these laws will pertain more towards gay men, but still. We would not feel safe, and that's what matters. 

(FWIW, my wife knew we were probably going to be invited and said ""fuck no"" to any idea of traveling there when I mentioned it. I didn't make a choice for the both of us by myself.)

I told Anna, no, I'm sorry but my wife and I would not be able to travel there. Well, she pressed why, I said ""because we're gay. That country criminalizes gay people."" She just said ""oh"" and kind of awkwardly changed the topic. 

Later though, I got a text. She said she felt I  embarrassed her for not knowing and while she didn't know, it's not like she's homophobic or anything, just that she wants to go on a trip there and why did I have to be so blunt about it? 

I'm really frustrated, and also- I feel bad. I'm not sure why. I guess I could have made an excuse, that airfare is pricey right now or we had something else planned but? My wife is saying I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know. AITA? 

EDIT- forgot to add, but I didn't include which country because I felt it was wrong. The government etc makes these choices- I would feel bad putting the blame on a whole country that certainly has an LGBTQ population, hidden or not. It's in the Middle East and that's all I'll say.

"AITA for telling my SIL to walk her daughter to school? I (f23) am a university graduate and live at home with my mother. She owns the house with a mortgage that's been fully paid off. I pay her rent (around half of the market rate for our area) and do most of the housework. Me and my mother both work a lot, I work in healthcare and work irregular shift patterns and my mum is self-employed and occasionally has to travel for work.  
  
My brother (m31), his wife ""Rose"" (f31) and their daughter (f6) moved back into our mum's house on Friday. They got a mortgage on a home but it turned out to have a lot of maintenance issues, the biggest ones being with their toilet and shower not functioning. Also their heating doesn't work. It's estimated to take at least a month to fix everything so in the meantime they're staying here.  
  
Rose came to me and asked if I could take their daughter to school, as her school is a 5 minute drive from the hospital. Normally their neighbour (who has a child the same age) would take her to school but that's no longer an option. My brother works full-time and his shifts clash with doing this (he starts at 7am) and he and Rose share a car, as she only works one shift a week on Sundays.  
  
I told Rose that I can't commit to taking my niece to school everyday. She needs to be dropped off at school for 8am, and sometimes I'm doing overnight shifts that don't finish until 9-10am or I'm doing shifts that start really early in the morning.  
  
Rose got a bit upset and asked why I can't just explain to my boss that I need to be available for school drop-off. She didn't wait for an answer and said she knows it's not that simple but she needs me to help her. In my job, if you start requesting restricted availability, they will give you way less shifts.  
  
I couldnt understand why Rose wouldn't walk her daughter to school, as it's a 15 minute walk from our mum's house to get there, with no hills and plenty of safe crossings. Rose and their daughter don't have any health conditions that would make this not doable. I asked Rose why she wouldn't walk her daughter to school and she said that is too far to walk with a young child. I showed her the distance on Google maps (I assumed she wasn't aware of how close it was) and she reiterated that it was too far.  
  
I said to Rose I think that's her best option but I cannot take her daughter to school everyday.  
  
Later that day my mum told me that Rose came to her really upset that I refused to help. My mum said she knows I normally work irregular shifts but that it'd be a really nice thing for me to do. I feel like I'm going crazy because when I was a kid I went to the same school and my mum walked me there and back from this house!! I said no and my mum said that's fine I understand.  
  
Now I've got my brother calling me selfish and he said it's a small ask that even their neighbour could do it and I'm refusing.

"AITA for telling my brother in law to stop picking on my kids or he’s not coming on vacation? I have three kids, Rob (16m), Lisa (14f), Anne (9F). Lisa is autistic, and her special interest is Taylor Swift. Rob and Anne go along with it and indulge her. They’re good kids who care and support each other and Rob and yes Anne get attention and support for their interests too.

My brother in law Hector's entire personality is trying to rile people. You know the whole “it’s just a joke bro”. Super childish but whatever “he’s family.” Except my husband is out of the country, so I guess he thinks he gets to do whatever he wants.

A few weeks ago he started needling at Lisa by making fun of Taylor Swift using lots of childish name calling words, intentionally using the wrong word for fans and stuff. Just really immature kid stuff. Lisa knows that not everyone likes TS and some people even hate her. One of her best friends hates her. She’s not unable to hear different opinions. She has her own I’m sure she’d LOVE to share with you all if you had 4 hours to spare.

He would say “Well Swiffers did x y z” she would say “Uncle Hector it’s Swifties” and he would say it again to needle at her. Rob was in the room, I was not. Rob said to him “Why do you keep using the wrong word, she told you the right word?”

Hector said he can say whatever he wants and to “cry about it.”

Rob said “It just seems like you’re going out of your way to upset Lisa”

Rob asked her to finish what she was talking about and to ignore Hector. This is when I came into the room, and Hector waved at the kids and said “Roberta’s getting real mad that someone’s joking about mother (?)”

(I wasn’t in the room so I didn’t hear the comment about me and Rob said I wouldn't get it)

Before I could say anything Rob said “Bro did you really just call me a girl’s name? Are you 12?”

I put my hands up and said okay enough, Hector, stop. He said I’m raising soft kids who can’t take a joke. I said he’s being so effing rude and that he wouldn’t be acting like this if my husband was home. I said that if he wants to still go with us to Colorado in the summer like we were planning, he has to stop NOW or he’s not coming.

This set him off and he said I had no right to do that (yes I do) and that I’m being a controlling yak over Taylor Swift. I said no, fuck Taylor Swift, this is about you being mean to your niece because her dad isn't home.

He said fuck you and good luck next time we have a problem, we’re on our own. He took his Costco chicken and left and I swear he must have immediately gone running to my MIL because she called me to ask for what really happened and sighed a lot. I asked her if I was overreacting and she said she just hopes we can work it out because that trip was all he had to look forward to since he was laid off from work. I HATE causing drama in the family so am I the asshole and I’m out of line?

  
Thanks for all the feedback, I have a path forward. It also needs to be said that some of you are just inventing an entirely new story involving Hector losing his job because his has a bad personality. This is entirely fictional, this didn't happen. His job laid off almost everyone because they are struggling with money and likely won't recover. ",Not the A-hole,1jp0a41
"AITA for calling ski patrol on a guy after he hit my son with his skis? My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way. 

My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad.

"AITA: I was yelled at today by a male co worker and clapped back I was yelled at today by a male co worker and clapped back. Still unsure if I did the right thing

I'm part of a team of 6 developers and I'm the only woman in the team. We have several teams and I get along well with everyone. I'm usually thought of us as nice to everyone, and joking around etc. I've heard several co workers tell me that they enjoy working with me.

Today I got into an altercation with one of my male co workers. He is stubborn and is known to have outbursts at people. Especially if we don't do exactly as he wants us to. He seems to struggle with nuances and gets mad at you if you don't solve something code related in the way that pleases him. He has been working at this company for over 10 years, whereas I've been here for a year so there's that. I've never been micro managed by someone as much as him and he is not even my manager or boss.

In short, the altercation was this: I was handed a document with descriptions of how certain software components in our code base is intended to work. Some of the descriptions are newly revised, so I have to rewrite code to fit the new description.

The descriptions were unclear, so I decided to email the engineer who had written the document. He is very well versed into the system design of these components, we can call him M. As I was typing my email, my male co worker exploded and was yelling ""I KNOW THESE THINGS, YOU SHOULD ASK ME. STOP BOTHERING M"". I'm usually cold in these situations and don't really care about his outbursts, but this one really caught me due to his usage of the words ""bothering"". I was typing a two sentence email, and he made it sound like I was sending M 100 of emails.

I looked back and responded ""I'm sorry, are you my boss or something? I'm emailing him because I want his explanation since he has written this document"". And he responded by saying ""you're so rude, that's so rude of you"" and I was like ""yeah, then go and cry about it"".

When I said the last words, the entire landscape went quiet. Usually no one stands up to this co worker and he is having angry outbursts without anyone stepping in and this is the first time I stood up for myself.

Did I do something wrong in this situation? Like, is it normal to have these outbursts at co workers? I'm second guessing myself all the time but I really feel like he is the unreasonable one.",Not the A-hole,1ldvlba
"AITA for trying to set a boundary with my little sister after she opened my birthday present? 23F, little sister is 13F. I live back &amp; forth between my mum’s and my dad’s house. All of my siblings are half-siblings on my dad’s side.

I love my little sister but lately I've been getting annoyed about certain boundaries she crosses.

She’s obsessed with face cream, hand cream, body spray, perfume, any hair products that smell good, lip gloss/balm - she has a very big collection of all these things. I once sat and counted how many lip stuff she has accumulated over the years and I counted 37. Despite having TONS of her own, she always asks to borrow mine and often ends up using up the entire thing (one of my perfumes was almost completely used up because she would spray it at *least* 20 times every time she used it)

She gets upset if I don’t share my stuff with her. For example, I got a body mist from Bath &amp; Body Works recently because I loved the smell. I decided to leave it at my mum’s house. My sister saw it in the background during a facetime and said “oh that looks like it smells good, can you bring it the next time you come here?!” and I jokingly said something along the lines of “I think we’ve got more than enough perfumes at dads”, and she was visibly upset.

I’m quite a patient person so I brush all of this off bc she’s my lil sister and that's just what siblings do, right? But this recent situation has really upset me and I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not. So:

It was my birthday on Tuesday. I went to my dad’s to celebrate after work. When I sat down to open presents I noticed that all of them were intact except one, of which the packaging had been ripped open and the contents removed. Hm, weird, so I asked my little sister what happened and she told me that it was one of my brother’s gifts to me (a set that included hand cream, a nail file, a nail/cuticle oil, and a little nail clipper) and she “really wanted to try it” and couldn’t wait for me to open it so she decided to go ahead and open it herself and try everything out. Half the hand cream had been squeezed out of the tube, the nail file was used because it had those tell tale scratches on it, and the small nail/cuticle oil bottle wasn’t closed properly so it was also opened. I understand that, in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a big deal, but it made me sad that she had just gone and opened my gift like that without even thinking to consult me first.

I said to her, verbatim, “You need to stop thinking all of my things are automatically yours too.”

Her mum taught her that everything that belongs to your siblings also belongs to you. Her philosophy: siblings share everything. So, setting a boundary is very difficult; 

My sister got mad because I “never share” my things with her anymore and am “purposely” leaving some of my stuff at my mum’s place to avoid her using them. Her mum called me “quite selfish” for belittling my own sister for wanting to be “closer to me” by borrowing my things.

My son works on carbo ships, he is hard to contact and is gone for weeks to months at a time. He will not be around for the holidays. He is married to Daisy.

Life has been rough for the couple the past two years. Daisy became unemployed and hasn’t found work that is flexible enough with the kids. My son is gone often so he can’t help with the kids.

A common issue that has been happening is that Daisy will sell the kids things online for extra cash. I really don’t approve especially since she still is getting her nails done every two weeks still.

The kids get into trouble and so she sells there things.

My granddaughter only had her new switch video game for two weeks before it was sold. Daisy claimed she was playing too aggressively with the game but when I asked she could not give me examples.

So the 70 dollar switch game got sold on Ebay. This also only ever happens with  ”expensive“  gifts. I have talked to her about it bit she denies it.

Daisy asked me to buy the two kids iPads for Christmas. They are expensive and I am worried she is going to sell them. So I have set them up already and made it so she needs a pasword to get into the setting app. That way she can not wipe them and sell them.

I called her up today and informed her I got the kids ipad and explained that I put a password on the setting app.

In short she was pissed but I made it clear this is the only way I am gifting them the iPads. I have been getting texts constantly about me over stepping

"AITA for forcing my diet on my boyfriend? I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.

I had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.

I spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.

I stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.

The comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.

"AITAH, for refusing to sign my neighbors “Use of Yard” waiver? Last Thursday, my neighbors approached my wife regarding a Use of Yard waiver since they don’t have the clearance to move excavators and bobcats to their backyard to build a pool. The waiver states they need 10ft of clearance (4ft would be into our yard based on my measurements) and they would repair the grass to its original state. I have an irrigation system and internet lines which run beneath the area which would be used. The neighbors were leaving for FL and asked for a 48 hour turnaround.

I spoke to the pool company on Friday and the PM said they need 10-12ft and they need the waiver because there is a good chance the ground will be totally torn up.

It was my wife’s 30th birthday this weekend so this situation was not top of mind but my neighbor knocks on the door Saturday afternoon asking for a response. I kindly explain I am not comfortable signing the current waiver given the typos, lack of notarization, and ambiguities regarding repairs. He takes it personally and storms out of the house complaining about how much money he is going to lose.

Today, the project manager from the pool company knocks on our door asking what they can do to resolve this. I told him I really don’t want my yard torn up but at minimum a new waiver needs drafted and I would consider it. He then says we have an electrical easement which runs 1.5ft into our yard in the exact spot he wants to use and would just call for access. I check my plat design and deed to see there is NOT any easement running thru the area they need. He leaves and the situation is still up in the air.

Edit: thanks everyone for your input. I had run this situation by many friends and colleagues and the answers were consistently “no” unless you can get outrageous stipulations and even so it is still a risk.

"AITA for telling my dad's wife I'm sorry but she's not my mom? I (16M) was the product of what is pretty much a friend with benefits type relationship between my dad (at the time 33) and my mom (at the time 22.) My mom didn't want to be a mom. Yet my dad didn't want my mom to abort. From what little I have been told there was an agreement. My mom would leave, my dad would raise me on his own but if she wanted to, she could come back into my life whenever.





The first 7 years of my life were just my dad and I. He didn't date any other woman; it was just us two and his family. I remember my mom would send me gifts on my Birthday and Christmas with letters attached. I remember members of her family doing the same. When I turned 7, my mom came back. I started spending time with her. She would take me to parks, zoos, and aquariums etc. I also met her family. I loved this, although I now know my dad didn't like the fact that my mom randomly showed up out of nowhere wanting to spend time with me, although he did soften up to it over time. I still have contact with my mom. I don't see her as often as before. But I still love her and see her as much as possible.



There was no conflict due to this situation at all until when I was 14, my dad met a new woman. I will call ""A"" for this. A and my dad started dating when I was 14, married when I was 15. A brought her twins (15M for both) from her previous relationship into her marriage with my dad. I have a good relationship with both my stepbrothers. I have a decent relationship with A but 2 things always bugged me. 1. How my dad seemed to rush into marrying A (he proposed to her 3 months into their relationship.) 2. A wanted me to call her mom literally the day I met her. She had two reasons for this. 1. I don't have a mom, and I need one. 2. She wants our family to be more united. I always just shrugged this off. I got away with it because when my dad married A it's like he forgot about me completely and didn't care about me. I also felt like it wasn't my place to complain. 



That's the context of all of this. We're a year into Dad and A's marriage. A's birthday is coming up. All of us bought her a gift but she says she doesn't like physical ones and also said she wants a more ""verbal gift"" from me. Last night at dinner I learned what this was. She asked me if I say yes to letting her adopt me so she could be my mom. Of course it caught me off guard. I said no, I already have a mom. A doesn't like the fact I talk to my actual mom still, and she said that she's my mom because she's at home with me every day and is married to my dad. Then called my actual mom a part timer in my life. I told her no, I'm sorry I can't her son but even if my actual mom is a part timer she was there for me a long time before she was. I received an angry scolding for this from both my dad and A. A specifically has been cold towards me since then.

"AITA for not telling my uncles we won’t inherit anything? Before my(18m) grandma passed away, she and I had an arrangement. She gave me money to buy horror novels and I read them to her twice a week. We spent a fair amount of time together.

During one of our last sessions, she confided in me that she wanted to leave all her money to charities but decided to leave a college fund for my cousin(16f) since ‘Uncle Henry’ lost a massive part of his savings through gambling. The guy thought he could recover all he lost by making a big bet on Mike Tyson but then Jake Paul won, so he ended up losing even more.

Grandma asked me not to tell anyone about this and I didn’t. I kept my mouth shut.

When my dad and uncles found out, they reacted in different ways. Dad wasn’t really that surprised since Grandma was rather charitable, especially in her later years. Uncle Henry was grateful for the fund but ‘Uncle John’ was quite upset, saying that she’s their mom and should have left them something

All three of them got suspicious and asked me if Grandma told me about this during one of the afternoons I spent at her place. I admitted that I knew about it and Uncle John said I should’ve told them first instead of letting them find out this way. That it wouldn’t hurt so much if he had time to prepare instead of being caught off guard.",Not the A-hole,1if2mc6
"AITA for replacing pictures of my cousins with pictures of my dog My grandpas birthday was a couple weeks ago. 6 weeks before his birthday, I texted all of my siblings and cousins (there’s 9 of us) and told them to send me a picture of themselves within the next 4 weeks so I could put it on a phone case for our grandpa’s birthday. 

2 weeks later I sent the text again, saying I needed a picture of them and anybody that chooses not to send a picture will be replaced by a picture of my dog. I had 3 cousins tell me to screenshot something from their instagrams. I didn’t respond. 

I sent a text out the day before I put in the order saying anybody that did not send a picture of themselves in the next 24 hours would be replaced by pictures of my dog. 

The same 3 cousins never sent pictures. Their spots have my dog in a sombrero, my dog at the pumpkin patch, and my dog in a chicken costume. 

They came over for my grandpas birthday and saw him open his new phone case. They saw that their pictures weren’t on the case and got mad at me for not picking something off their instagrams like they told me to. I said that I sent 3 reminders to send me a picture with a clear warning that anybody that did not send a picture would be replaced with a picture of the dog. They knew exactly what would happen. 

My grandpa finds it hilarious but their parents are telling my parents that I kept them off the phone case on purpose and they want me to apologize.

"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my more fit coworker? I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.

My co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. 

The issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.

The issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the ""strong counselor"". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am ""embarrassing"" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy ""like me"". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure.

"AITA for explaining to my future SIL why her kids will never receive anything from us? I (27F) have a brother (33M) who has been dating his girlfriend Sarah for 2 years and he proposed a couple of moths ago. Sarah has 2 kids from her previous relationship 8M &amp; 6F. I would say that my parents and I are not very close to Sarah and her kids but we are cordial and never had any problems before. 

My partner, I, bro and Sarah attended the Easter dinner at my parents and that's when the drama happened. Sarah's kids were at their father's so Sarah used this celebration to confront us about my brother requesting a prenup. Basically my brother explained to her that he expects them to sign a prenup and that only his biological kids will have the right to inherit anything from our family assests. This is something that we as a family discussed before and we all agree that only our children should receive assests or money from our inheritance. My brother is free to pay whatever he wants for his stepchildren out of his own money, but my children and his bio children will never have to share anything that our family has with them.

Sarah claimed that we are being unfair and that we are treating her and her kids like some strangers instead of embracing them like family. She said that the normal and decent thing to do was for us to see her kids like my brother's kids who should have equal rights to any children they may have together. I told her sure, after she gets married to my brother she will become our in law and her kids will be my brother's stepchildren but this does not mean we have to share anything with them. I asked her, will my future kids receive anything from her parents or from their bio father's parents? She said no obviously so I asked her than why would her kids be entitled to receive anything from us? Sarah said because they will be our family so I told her that we have plenty of cousins that are also family but I don't go around wishing to share my inheritance with them. 

There was a lot more back and forth between us and Sarah was not letting this go. My brother asked her to stop because we were there to celebrate Easter, not to have this kind of conversation but she kept on going saying we need to clarify it once and for all. I told her from where we stand everything is clear and it is only her who has a problem. She said we are  greedy and cruel to some kids and I snapped. I told her to deal with it. She is free to work her ass off and gather assets to leave to her children but we will never divide anything outside of our family and she should not expect her children to be our problem or burden to finance. 

I honestly feel she is very manipulative and is using my brother for what she and her kids can get from him but that's my brother's problem to decide if this is the kind of partner he wants. I just want to know if I was too blunt in telling her the truth.

"AITA for no longer giving support to my wife's family after I became successful with my own company after they talked down about me. My (early-30's) wife (mid-20's) grew up in a fairly poor enviroment. Her grandpa had money, but her mom didn't and her sister doesn't. My wife has an incredibly strong work ethic (she's probably moreso defined as a workaholic). When I first met her, I was in trucking, making about 50k-70k/year. Since then I developed a niche for a speciality marketing field and became very good at it. All my friends encouraged me to go into business for myself with a marketing company. My wife was fully supportive of this, even after we discussed the financial difficulties we would have for the first year or so due to a l limited budget. I made sure she knew that some months, I may not get a check from the business (my salary is paid monthly). 

Her family, however, were not. They accused me of neglecting my family, being lazy, not wanting to work, etc. They would constantly be bringing up the fact that I ""didn't have a job"" because I was always home (working remote). She would defend me, but they would ignore it and continue to call me lazy and a ""deadbeat"" for putting my daughter in daycare while I worked from home. I was still driving a truck part-time to have steady, reliable income but it was only half of what I was making on a good week. 

In the last year however, I have grown my income from my business beyond what I was making in trucking, and have very little overhead. Since we cut costs back when I first started, we realized a lot of things we were paying for, we could do without or found other alternatives and we never really added those expenses back so it's like we have significantly more money now. I still drive a semi occasionally for a friend who owns his truck (mainly to keep my CDL active and stay knowledgable in the industry as a fallback).

Her family has taken note, and they are constantly asking to go out to eat with us, hang out with us, etc then get mad when I never pay for the meals, the outing, the vacation, etc (aside from my part of the tab, obviously). Looking back, I understand why they never had money, they were living well beyond their means, but if it makes them happy then it is what it is. 

I let my wife do whatever she wants with her money (which sometimes includes buying stuff for her family, which I support her doing with her money if that's how she wants to spend it) but I make sure that she knows I don't want a dime of my money going to her family since they were very unsupportive of what made us our money and would go as far as to talk down about me for doing what lead to our money.

"AITA for not letting a kid eat my food? The other day I was at the mall with my boyfriend and our two kids (F5 and M6), we were sitting eating a bag of roasted chestnuts when this kid (around 10 yo) starts hovering around us.

Now, I admit I'm not the biggest fan of any kid that doesn’t belong to me, so this alone was already annoying me slightly but I still smilled to him.

Then he calls my son over and whispers in his ear, and I knew it was about the chestnuts. My son nods yes and the boy comes up to me and reaches for a chestnut, I moved bag and said ""no, you have to go ask your parents"". My boyfriend got upset, called me rude and handed a chestnut to the boy. The boy leaves and I tell my boyfriend he shouldn't have done that, that you don't just give food to a strange kid.

The boy than hovers back around us and without a word snatches two chestnuts from the bag that my boyfriend was now holding. I stand up and said very firmly ""sorry but you can't take our stuff like that, go to your parents"". He put them back and ran off.

I think the kid had no ~~education~~  manners and I wasn't gonna let my kids think it's okay to accept anything from strangers, or that it's okay to be pressured into sharing. My boyfriend doesn’t agree and thinks the kid trusted us because we had kids ourselves. He thinks I was just selfish.

"AITA for yelling at a mom and her kid to get out of my home? *There is an update to this on my profile, as I have not been able to post it to the subreddit.*

A few months ago, I (28F) started a new DnD campaign and invited a few friends. One of them, “Sarah”, asked if her friend “Anne” could join. Anne is a mom who doesn’t get many chances to hang out with adults, so I agreed, even though I knew she might be flaky due to childcare responsibilities. I asked Anne if she could attend at least the first few sessions to get familiar with the game, and she agreed.

She then proceeded to cancel, mostly last minute, every proposed first session for the next two months. I told her I'm sorry but if she can't make it to the next proposed session, she won't be in long campaigns (still welcome to join one-shots). She apologized and said she'll make it.

She made it. But brought her toddler without asking.

As soon as they came the kid needed to use the bathroom. He made a mess since he can't fully use an adult toilet yet. I told Anne that's fine but asked her to clean it up. This surprised her and she started being a bit on edge.

We finally sat down at the table and the kid started running around, looking for things to do. I was a bit stressed out by this. Anne noticed and put him in her lap. But now the kid was at the table, which was covered in mini figurines, dice, pretty pictures and maps, most being a choking hazard, along with glasses of various drinks. The kid started fussing about wanting to play with them, I was telling Anne no because it's not safe, she told me he's gentle and doesn't put stuff in his mouth- we bickered while her kid was throwing a tantrum. After the kid knocked over a glass, I loudly asked her to step out into the backyard and calm him down a bit while I make the table safer.

She did, visibly embarrassed, and I removed everything except for plain looking papers, pens and paper cups. I also did my best to calm down as this entire thing stressed me out to hell and back at this point.

They came back and things were fine for a minute. That is, until my dog came out of my bedroom to drink water. Now, I don’t have many house rules, but I have one that’s important: **“Ignore the dog”**, they were informed of that before coming over. The kid spotted her and yelled ""DOGGY"", Anne put him down ""to say hi"", he made a full speed beeline at my dog while making grabbing motions and yelling. I stopped him by stepping out in front of him, he ran into me, fell down and started crying. Anne started screaming at me, I screamed back, and very swiftly told her to get the f out of my home. Sarah was annoyed and told us it took them an hour and a half to get to me, then went with Anne since they carpooled.

The rest stayed, it was awkward for half an hour or so, but we ended up having fun and they even stayed for the night.

I then woke up to the local fb groups and people's instagram stories calling me a controlling asshole, saying I'm ""discriminating"" against various players, being too strict and ""have a dangerous dog"". To add insult to injury, Sarah, who I've been friends with for years, is not speaking to me.

"AITA: My husband made himself a frozen meal for lunch and complained it was disgusting and threw it away. I felt bad and I offered to let him have one that I had been saving for myself...only to discover that what he had thrown away was my lunch. I then got upset at him and told me to ""pick a lane."" So, every now and then I buy a random frozen meal to keep on hand for lunch emergencies. I had one in the freezer for a month. My husband saw it a few weeks ago and asked if ""that was his"" (because he can't remember anything he buys or adds to the grocery list), and I said, ""No, that's mine.""

Fast forward to yesterday: I hear him nuking something in the kitchen, then he loudly declares it’s ""absolutely disgusting,"" tosses it down the sink, and starts whining about not having lunch. I hadn’t eaten that frozen meal and I did not think I would need it this week, so I thought, “Well, if I let him have it, he’ll have something to eat and I’ll just grab another one next time I’m at the store.” I offer him the meal I was saving. He asks which one, I say ""The white bean chicken chili."" He goes, ""That’s what I just threw away.""

Cue my rage. ""Wait, you took my lunch without asking and then threw it away when you didn’t like it?"" He says, ""You wouldn’t have liked it, it was completely different from chili."" I’m like, ""Yeah, I KNOW, it’s *white bean chicken chili*—it’s not supposed to be like regular chili. That’s why I bought it.""

His response? ""Well, it was disgusting."" I said, ""You didn’t even check what it was, didn’t remember it was mine, and when you didn’t like it, you threw it away instead of asking me about it.""

He goes, ""But you offered it to me."" I reply, ""Yeah, I offered it because I thought you had nothing else. But now that I know you just grabbed my meal without asking, and didn’t even eat it and threw it out instead and did not even ask if I wanted it when you decided you were not going to eat it, I’m a little pissed.""

He then got mad and started telling me I was setting him up, that no matter what he did he was wrong and I was being unreasonable. He told me to ""pick a lane.""

I tried to explain why I was mad and said, ""Imagine you heard me complaining about something I recently bought, and I decided I didn’t like it, so I just threw it away. Then, you have this gift card you’ve been saving for yourself, and you say, ‘You know, I was saving this for myself, but since you already spent your money on something you didn’t like, you can have my gift card to buy something better.’ So, I go, ‘Oh, well, thanks but I already used your gift card to buy the thing I didn’t like and threw away. I saw it lying on the counter, so I just used it.’”

My question is, AITA because I got mad at him after I discovered he ate took my lunch and then threw it away, even though there was a brief moment where he appeared to have nothing to eat for lunch so I offered him mine?

Update:

OP here providing some basic answers:

We have been together nearly 20 years; we are in our late 40s/early 50s (he is older).

Grocery shopping is done like this: I make a list of things I want/need for myself and for recipes I plan on making. He does the same and add them to our communal list. I go to the store and buy everything once a week (same day every week as that is how my schedule allows). He will usually go to the store separately on his own multiple times a week (at least 3 days usually 4) because he wants one specific thing or forgot to add something to the list or ran out of something and buys things for himself; these could be snacks, frozen lunches, or once in a while something we communally ran out of and need ASAP to cook dinner with or something like that.

He usually buys enough frozen meals or relies on leftovers for lunch; I do something similar except most of the time I do not rely on frozen things, I take time to prepare lunch each day (sandwich, omelette, random snacks, leftovers). Every week when I do the grocery shopping I plan what I am having that week for lunches and ensure I buy the things I need. The frozen things I buy usually 1 of to keep on hand in an emergency - such as I have no time to prepare a lunch and need to quickly throw something in the microwave. That is why I tend to buy just one every once in a while and it sits there like a spare tire in the trunk of the car. Also, I tend to always buy something that I know he won't enjoy, to deter him from eating it because he will just eat whatever is there even if I say ""oh hey I was saving that."" I have to do the same with snacks - if I buy a bag if chips or a box of crackers he will just plow through it in a day. My work around there is to either not buy snack food for myself, or go to extremes to find things he will not eat, like the one flavor he hates.

This happens a lot. Like I buy a certain type of protein bar that I use during my workouts and he will eat them like they are candy bars and then when I go to grab one for my workout - empty box. And if I ask him to please make sure he replaces them if he is going to eat them all, he gets angry and says he ""should not have to ration food."" I told him it was not rationing, it was simply making sure that if I buy something for a specific meal or purpose for myself, that I expect it to be there when I need it. This is an ongoing debate between us, and I am trying to not turn it into a hill to die on.

As to history - he most likely has undiagnosed ADD (we're older GenX, these things were not recognized as often when we were growing up). He has all the classic signs. He is also academically brilliant and can often block everything out (Sounds, things in his visual line of sight) when he is laser focused on something that is cognitively engaging. So he very likely forgot that I said it was mine. However, he could have read the label clearly; also it had been in the freezer for a month so I assumed he knew that was my backup emergency lunch.

Finally - when he does not like the taste of something he does tend to overreact in a very dramatic way, like gagging/screaming as if one was being poisoned as opposed to just quietly going ""gross...not going to eat this."" I sometimes wonder if he is also on the spectrum because has has quite visceral yet unusual reactions to very specific situations, such as when the smoke alarm goes off, when he does not like the taste of something...whereas I would just deal he has a rather over the top reaction.",Not the A-hole,1ja1n9k
"AITA for not defending a girl I barely know after she was kicked out of the friend group for asking to be paid? I (21f) have a group of 6 friends. 2 months ago, a new girl (Jane-22f) was introduced to the group.

For context, one thing our friend group does is ‘trade’ services. For example, I’ll do one of my friend’s nails for free and she’ll do my hair for free when I need it doing in the future. We generally try to keep the trades within the same price range. For example, if my hair costs £60, I’ll trade doing nails for £60-£70. Anything over £10 is usually paid on top of the free service (if my hair costs £60 and the nails are £100, my friend will pay me £40).

To be clear, there is ZERO obligation to do these trades and to my knowledge, no one has been pressured into one. It’s all about favours and doing nice things for your friends.

Anyways, Jane joins the group 2ish months ago and immediately starts asking about my nails. At one point, she says she can’t afford to get hers done right now so I asked her if she wanted to do a trade. Jane makes her own t shirts/clothing/accessories. The nails I ended up doing on her cost £160. When it was my turn to pick clothes/accessories, I ended up leaving with about £70 worth. I told her not to worry about ‘paying’ me back with the £90. All in all, I thought it was a good experience and I got to talk to Jane one-on-one. It was fun.

Until Wednesday (the 11th of December). I get a text from Jane apologising and saying she realised she can’t afford to just ‘give away’ £70 worths of her stuff and she needs me to pay her asap or she needs the stuff back. At first, I’m really confused because I could not have been more clear about the how the trades work and I never forced her into one. I apologised back to her but said I didn't have some of the smaller items as I planned to gift them to my sister for her birthday. Jane then kept telling me to just 'pay her back'. I said I would when I get paid from my job.

The issue then became her texting. She went to our group chat to complain about me not paying her for the clothes she gave me. She ended up letting it slip it was a trade and everyone told her she can't back out of a deal weeks after it happened. She ended up taking to tiktok to complain about how I 'stole' from her and am refusing to pay her back. In response, she was kicked out of the friend group.

However now the group is split. Half say I should have just paid her as she does seem to be genuinely struggling, while the other half say I am under no obligation to pay her due to the agreed terms of the trade. The first group think I'm kind of an asshole and Jane definitely thinks I am... so AITA?

EDIT: some people are questioning how my nails cost £160. I do custom sets that involve hours of art/'construction' (of charms, stamps, etc).

"AITA for leaving a party because my date refused to get me water? I had been seeing someone I met through mutual friends. We’d had good times one-on-one, and when he invited me to events with his friends, I’d contribute to the group dynamic by never showing up empty handed and offering to grab drinks for others.

Fast forward to a holiday-themed party with his friends. My date and I planned to meet there and hang out afterward. I spent the day cleaning my condo and preparing mulled wine to bring. During the party, people were getting drinks for one another, including me when I served the wine.

At one point, I was sitting on the couch, blocked in by only my date on one said and many others on my other side. I was tired and didn’t feel like tightly squeezing past people I didn’t know, so I asked my date if he could grab me a glass of water. He shook his head and after I said “huh” he said, “No. I was just up, and you could’ve asked before I sat down again.” I was taken aback because I view small gestures, like grabbing water, as basic acts of care for friends, but especially for someone you’re dating.

That moment, combined with a long day of preparation, left me feeling drained. Since the party was winding down and I didn’t have the energy to engage further, I said my goodbyes and called a ride. My date offered to walk me out and said he felt hurt that I was leaving. I explained I needed to recharge but that he was welcome to come over after the party.

As we walked out, I jokingly mentioned how him not getting me water surprised me. He replied, “Wow, that really upset you, huh? I have to be guarded about these things, you know.”

Later, we texted, but he seemed more upset about me leaving than interested in listening to why I felt drained. When I tried to call, he didn’t answer. His texts were curt, and I eventually told him I’d let him decompress. Two days later, I called to discuss what happened. He said he’d call that evening but didn’t reach out until three days later, saying, “I’m not dodging you, I’ve just been busy.” At that point, I was over it, especially since he never acknowledged the misunderstanding or my attempts to resolve it.

A month later, we finally had a conversation. He explained that getting me water felt “subservient” and was something I had to earn through time and “being in the trenches with him.” He also said I didn’t understand how busy his life was (for context, I work multiple jobs). I calmly explained that grabbing water for someone isn’t about being subservient but a small act of kindness.

After reflecting, I feel his responses and handling of the situation were disrespectful and indicative of bigger issues.

"AITA For telling my sister that her lack of personal hygiene is the real reason no job will hire her and not sexism? This concerns my sister “Lily” who is graduating soon. Our parents taught us the importance of personal hygiene and keeping yourself presentable. But I guess Lily fell off the wagon while dorming in college because it feels like she dropped everything to do with personal hygiene since moving back home.



It’s easier to explain with a list of things she isn’t taking care of:



Hair: Very oily/greasy and always tangled from lack of wash and brushing.



Skin: Also very oily/greasy from no wash.



Nails: Never trims so they’re long and yellow from grime.



Clothes: Clothes themselves are nice but she leaves them sloppy/wrinkled.



Body: Showers once a week tops. I’m not sensitive to smell, but my sister REEKS and honestly makes me gag sometimes.



Lily is upset because she says she can’t get an in-person job in her field and wants to give up. Our parents have tried telling her that presentability/hygiene is as important as credentials when getting jobs, but my sister won’t listen. Lily has a rocky relationship with our family so she takes it as a personal attack rather than them trying to help.



Lily is now blaming sexism and says men are all just intimidated by a competent woman and that’s the sole reason why she hasn’t gotten a job. If she wants to lie to herself, it’s her life. Whatever. What I can’t stand is her trying to make it my problem and expect validation from me.



Lily just did a bunch interviews, but all went cold after and none panned out into jobs. She was venting to me last week about how companies in this field are all boys’ clubs and quick to shoot down a woman they know is intellectually above them. I was basically just like good for you, can I please finish my session in peace now?



Lily got defensive and said she’s just warning me. Then doubled down saying most men are selfish and I should save myself the headache now. She was saying this with my male friends on the voice call.



I had enough and told Lily that her lack of personal hygiene is the real reason no job will hire her, so stop blaming others and think for two seconds: If you were a company owner who needs to impress investors to keep your own family afloat, would you want to be represented by someone who looks and smells like a homeless person, or someone who is presentable and takes care of themselves? 



We got into an argument and Lily is now either giving me one-word answers or not saying anything to me at all. I’ll be honest that we argue a lot but Lily normally would have gotten over it by now. Did I do the right thing giving Lola a dose of reality or did I fuck up here?

"AITA for not moving out of the way after someone deliberately walked infront of me after seeing me So today I (24f, 5'2"") was on the way home from work and walked down the stairs to the underpass to get to my train track. *Since I was a kid I was taught to stick to the right side.* I was so far on the right side, that the wall was literally next to me. While moving down the stairs I see an old man (60ish) on *(my left/his right)* side like 20 meters away, we make eye contact and he starts moving to the (his left) side where I was walking through. Weird, I think, but I have recently started to not move out of the way when I am walking on the most right side, so I kept walking, wall barely touching my shoulder. He moves right in front of me, I keep refusing to move until he is right in front of me and blocks me. Now, the underpass is a good 10 meters wide, so he wouldve still had plenty of space to move around. I still refuse to move out of the way and also come to a stop. He stared at me for a few seconds, before ***touching my right shoulder***, unsuccsefully trying to push me away saying ""Attention Madam"". I look at him, smile, before also putting my hand on his shoulder, mimicking him and gently push him away saying ""Attention, sir"" at this point his smug grin turned to him looking dumbfounded as he finally moved away. But not without calling me an asshole. 

*I want to add that he walked completely normal and we were nowhere close the stairs anymore to which he wouldve needed the railing. We were also almost the only two people in the underpass*

AITA? 

Edit: I forgot to mention that I live in Switzerland. Also he started out on (my left his right) side of the underpass so he crossed a few meters over before ending up in my path. Also, I obviously do move for people with mobility issues or cant move around freely? The rule of not moving concerns people that are just as capable of moving as I am. ",Not the A-hole,1inpqxa
"AITA for refusing to take my shoes off in my friend’s house, causing his wife to cancel the DnD session for everyone? *Posting this on a throwaway because my friends know my main.*

I (38M) was invited to a DnD session with 4 other people at my friend Alex’s (34M) house. When I got there, his wife answered the door and immediately asked me to take my shoes off because they have a strict no-shoes policy due to them having a crawling baby.

I explained that I have a medical condition called epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), which makes the skin on my feet extremely fragile. Even mild friction or pressure can cause painful blisters and tears, so I have to wear supportive shoes with cushioned orthopedic insoles at all times, even indoors. Walking barefoot or just in socks causes me pain and can lead to bleeding.

She suggested I put grocery bags or socks over my shoes, but I told her that’s unsafe for walking and honestly just insulting. She said she “can’t compromise her baby’s health for my comfort.” When Alex came to the door, he told me to “just deal with it for a couple hours” or I wasn’t welcome inside. I told him I wasn’t going to risk injuring myself over a DnD session, and if my shoes were that big of an issue, I’d respectfully leave.

As I walked back to my car, I overheard his wife telling the other guests that were already there that the night was “off” because I “made a huge scene at the door.” Later, I got a group text from Alex saying he was canceling DnD night because “it’s not fair to expect everyone else to pretend nothing happened.”

Some mutual friends say I overreacted and could’ve just sucked it up, while others think Alex and his wife were ridiculous for ruining everyone else's plans just because I decided not to stay.

So, AITA?

**TL;DR:** I have a medical condition (EBS) that means I have to wear shoes indoors to protect my feet. My friend’s wife demanded I take my shoes off during DnD night for their crawling baby’s sake. I told them I would not participate and they ended up canceling the whole session.

  
**Edit:** I should add that I texted our friend group chat a few days ago about my concerns with my condition because we changed the location of the meetup to his house instead of mine. Alex reassured me that I shouldn't worry about it, so I didn't bring my indoor shoes.",Asshole,1mkirpx
"AITA for moving into a studio apartment away from my mother-in-law who moved in? Long story short, my boyfriend's mom is poor and had to move in to my boyfriend and I's apartment last month because my boyfriend's brother (who lived with her) got them both evicted. He stole her car and wrecked it into their apartment and almost killed someone. He's currently in rehab and before she moved in, I sat down with my boyfriend and laid out the requirements of her living here: she must cut off contact with his brother for his own good and never invite him over, as I'm afraid of him retaliating at our apartment and getting us evicted too, and she should stop enabling him with a constant safety net to continue his drug use (I know that sounds harsh but it was the only way to actually force him to get help, this has been an almost decade-long battle of her enabling him and he's not getting any better). My boyfriend agreed to this and she agreed. Cut to two weeks in, I come home from work. My boyfriend and her are laughing about how they took his brother to Golden Corral when I was gone and he was so high he was nodding off in the food. I was so upset that not only did she break the cardinal rule that I set for her but that my boyfriend went along with it and did it too. I told him I felt betrayed and that he just set a precedent to her that she can do whatever she wants now because any rule set isn't actually going to be enforced, clearly by his example. He told me he did it because he thought it was too harsh after the fact without telling me he had changed his mind, and thereby going against our agreement. I otherwise wouldn't have let her live here rent-free. My boyfriend said putting her on the street was too harsh of a punishment for breaking the rules, but isn't that the point? Now she's telling us we need to do HER chores when we pay the rent, because she doesn't want to do them, knowing he won't enforce or kick her out because he ultimately can't face the guilt of doing so. He has attachment issues with her and a heavy guilt complex.

Our apartment lease is up in a couple months and now that we're moving, she asked us ""So where are WE moving to?"" fully expecting a free-ride and free rent at our next place. I was so dumbfounded because she is only supposed to be here until she got housing, but low income housing waiting lists can be months to years long. I don't want to live with her anymore because she walks all over us and causes tension between my boyfriend and I. He will never put her on the street because he's controlled by his guilt. When I asked what he plans to do, he said he isn't taking her to our next place, but that would ultimately leave her on the street and I know deep down even if we initially move without her, she will be back in a week or two because he'll feel guilty. 

I want to move into a studio apartment now knowing that I don't believe he's going to let her go, and I've voiced this as a real possibility to him, but I'm being framed as trying to dismantle our relationship. AITA?

UPDATE: So it's been a few months and I still can't believe what an overwhelming response this post got. Needless to say you guys completely changed my life so thank you. I went ahead and got my own place when our lease ended. He got his own place about half an hour away and his mom managed to get accepted at an apartment of her own. I do genuinely hope her the best regardless of what happened but I don't keep in touch with her at all anymore. My bf and I decided that we should take some time apart and see other people, but we still keep in touch and he's always going to be someone that's important to me (I just think the limit of our relationship all along was friendship and not romantic, and that's okay). His brother has since been charged with some stuff and is in prison so that whole dynamic has changed as well. Having him out of the picture has been very emotional for everyone and again, I hope being in prison gets him the help he needs and he stays sober (he's not a bad person, just very misguided). Lastly, I've been exploring this new city on my own and trying my best to make new connections/discover things about myself, and this is my first time really socializing on my own since the pandemic so it's very liberating. I might've met someone special too 😏 but we're taking our time because I don't want to rush things, but none of this would've been possible without such unanimous support so thank you guys so much, I truly mean it 💖 ",Not the A-hole,1lekujs
"AITA for reporting my friend to the university after he cheated using my notes? I (22M) am in med school and have this friend, let’s call him Jake. We’ve studied together a few times, and I shared my annotated notes with him before a big exam. I made them myself, with diagrams, explanations, and even some mnemonics I came up with.

A few weeks later, one of our professors used one of my made-up mnemonics in a lecture, crediting “an anonymous student.” I was confused. Turns out Jake had submitted my notes (with his name on them) to the prof’s “student tips” portal, where students can share study tips for extra credit. He didn’t even mention me.

I confronted him, he brushed it off and said, “It’s just notes, chill.” So I reported it to the academic honesty office, since it technically falls under plagiarism. Now he’s under investigation and might lose the extra credit — or worse.

Our mutual friends are calling me petty and saying I could’ve just talked to him. AITA?

"AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me? So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

"AITA for not allowing my brother over for Christmas? My dad moved into our house because he’s disabled. My older brother stopped by one day right after Thanksgiving and my wife overheard them trash talk her. About the way she was dressed and how she’s “bitchy”

My wife is still semi livid at my father for saying those things so she refuses to interact with him or cook for him. (He complained about her cooking and why she was bitch was she told my dad “that’s the food I made eat it or starve"") My dad has never cooked or cleaned for himself.

"AITA for leaving a trip early because it got too expensive I female (28) went on a bachelorette for the weekend. Prior to the trip i let the group chat know that im on a budget and need to know the expenses in advance before i can agree. We all agreed on around $500 which i thought was doable. Before getting there we paid for the hotel and ride around since we were drinking. Which was $300. We split it to where the bride wouldn’t pay for these which I was fine with. Then when I arrived, we had our dinner planned and went to a fancy restaurant. I ordered the cheapest meal and then one of the girls took the bill and paid. Then following day i asked how much the tip was to pay my portion and the girls responded to just spilt the check and i said no my meal was nothing compared to them. Then they expected us to pay for the bride for everything she’s ordered the entire trip while she’s was getting the most expensive meals and drinks/flights at places. Then said why would you come here and not pay for everything for her. I understand paying for certain things for the bride but i wasn’t expecting to pay for her entire trip. Other bachelorettes ive been on didn’t do that. However if they would have told me in advance I could have planned, everyone knew but me. I told the bride that the girls were rude and that i can’t afford to stay and I’m uncomfortable. She said it was fine she appreciated my time.

"AITA for blowing up at my parents for something my adult sister did? I (26F) have a sister, “Amy” (28F), who has always had a difficult relationship with food. She was bullied as a kid and turned to food for comfort. As an adult, she still struggles with self-control, especially around things she finds appetizing. Our parents have never set boundaries with her around food, and that’s carried into adulthood—she currently lives with them, and they do all the grocery shopping and cooking.

My husband (28M) recently had a birthday, and I planned a surprise party. I sent him out of the house for a few hours so I could set up and asked my parents to come help. I specifically asked them not to bring Amy setting up involved putting out snacks, drinks, and a homemade cake with frosting.

They showed up with Amy anyway, saying it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her. I gave her a few small tasks and specifically asked her not to touch any of the food until guests arrived, but I was too busy to keep a constant eye on her.

At one point, I went into the kitchen and found Amy with the fridge open, eating the frosting out of the mixing bowl. She had eaten nearly half of it. As soon as she saw me, she burst into tears and said she only meant to try a little but couldn’t stop.

My parents heard us and came in. My mom said it wasn’t that big of a deal since the cake was untouched and I still had enough frosting for a crumb coat, but I had planned to do specific cake decorations, and now there wasn’t enough frosting; I didn’t have the time or ingredients to make more. My dad suggested going to the store to buy a tub of pre-made frosting, saying it was the same thing. I explained my husband tries to avoid a lot of the ingredients found in store-bought frosting and wouldn’t want that. My dad said to just not tell him since he “wouldn’t even know the difference“. 

That suggestion was super frustrating to me. I told my parents that they couldn't convince me that this was no big deal, and that they had allowed this by not setting boundaries with Amy’s binge eating and by bringing her to set up. They told me to back off and be more sensitive to my sister, and that it wasn’t her fault. I responded by saying that I was more angry at them, because at least Amy felt bad while they were trying to downplay the situation. 

They got upset and said it wasn’t fair to blame them for Amy’s choices, and that she was an adult and they can’t control her. They also said that they were trying to help by giving suggestions, and that I was being stubborn by shutting all of them down. They ended up leaving, and now they’re giving me the silent treatment, even though Amy has apologized for eating the frosting. AITA for involving them in this?",Not the A-hole,1l2j2zu

"AITA for ""having an intervention"" about my husband's parenting We have a 10 week old baby. Husband (28M) absolutely adores him and wants to spend every available moment with him. I know he wants to be an amazing father, however he enganges in unsafe behaviors like falling asleep on the couch while baby is contact napping, leaving baby on the playmat unattended while the dog is in the room or putting baby for a day nap with his bib still on.

Husband claims I'm too anxious, making a big deal out of nothing - baby can't roll yet and the dog won't hurt him, he holds baby firmly while sleeping etc. And I admit I don't react calmly and freak out, which makes him act defensive. But he is being unsafe and it stresses me out. I feel like I can't leave him alone with the baby which only offends him more.

But K was so excited to meet her new niece that I decided it was worth trying. With some assistance from me, she was able to hold her without issue. When our mother saw it happening, she was not happy. She said that it was irresponsible of me and repeated that Kylie's ""hands can't be trusted"" around the baby.

"AITA for telling a child no? Recently at a school event, the teacher asked if the parent group I'm a part of could provide cookies and cocoa.  I thought it might be nice to also provide things to add to the cocoa,  in this case marshmallows, whipped cream, and sprinkles. 

I had a child tell me that she doesn't drink cocoa and asked for just a cup of whipped cream. (Note she and her friends were the first in line. ) As she ate the chocolate chip cookies, I'm fairly certain it wasn't an allergy to chocolate, just a preference to not drink cocoa.  As soon as she asked, the five other kids wanted to have just a cup of the whipped cream too. So I could see where this would end up.  So I told her no,  that I was sorry,  I only had a limited supply of the whipped cream and if I told her yes I'd have to let everyone do it too and the people behind her in line wouldn't have the cream to add to their cocoa.  I offered her a cup to grab some water, but she stomped away mad.  Five minutes later, her mom came up and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and there was another immediate chorus of people wanting cups of whipped cream too. So I explained again about the whipping cream and the people in line, and mom stomped away mad.  A teacher who was attending the event with her child and not connected to the class or parent group (only add a child in the class) came up and asked,  with the predictable round of ""me too"". I again explained as there is still a line out the door and down the hall,  and only having a certain amount of whipped cream available, if I say yes to this child, I'll have to let everyone get cups of cream too, so I was sorry,  but the answer is no.  When this unconnected teacher caught me with my back turned, she took the whipped cream anyway and gave it to the child.  Which started an avalanche of folks wanting the same thing.  So I kept having to say no,  sorry,  no for the next 45 minutes until everyone had made it through the line.

"AITA for calling someone out of their white-elephant gift, that was significantly under the spending criteria? A social group that I'm a part of held a white-elephant gift exchange last night.  Participation was by absolutely no means mandatory or even expected.  The event was divided up between two pricing tiers; under $25 - $50 and $75 - $100.  The majority of members went with the less expensive tier for obvious reasons, and there's absolutely no *stigma* within our circle for doing so.  In fact only 9 out of our nearly forty members chose the more expensive tier, myself included.

Well I was picked to go 3rd and I selected a gift that was wrapped quite beautifully, thinking that was a good sign, but I was disappointed to discover the gift was a hot chocolate set that certainly wouldn't have met the criteria of the lower range, let alone the one we were participating in.  I could tell the others in the group felt roughly the same just by the looks on their face, and my focus was directed to one woman (Jen) who was looking away, clearly embarrassed.  As you might imagine, no one took my gift.

Now I know its petty not to be happy with what you're given, but let's be honest here in saying that Jen was throwing in the sort of thing you'd find on clearance at Walmart knowing full well she'd walk away with something pricey in turn.  In this case, Jen wound up with brand new Keurig.

I *discreetly* pulled our social group's leader aside and mentioned my concern to her.  She expressed she wasn't happy with this herself and that she'd even tried to tell Jen not to participate with the more expensive tier because it was well known that Jen wasn't doing great financially, but Jen had sworn up and down that it wouldn't be an issue.

We didn't want to disrupt events, so I was asked to put on a kind face and to avoid talking about the gift for the remainder of the evening, which I accepted as people were trying to have fun.

This morning I received a long winded text chain from Jen, expressing how frustrated she was that I'd demeaned her by complaining about her gift.  She went on and on about how nice it must be that I can simply throw my money away while others, like her, are struggling, and that her income shouldn't mean she can't have nice things.  Instead of fighting, I forwarded the texts to our group leader, and I've since received word that Jen would no longer be a member of our social group.

Now, if I'm being honest, I do genuinely feel bad because I know how happy being a member of this group made Jen.  She has had a lot of setbacks in her life.  I do not hate her or hold any negative feelings for her at all.  I simply felt she was knowingly taking advantage of the rest of us to basically trade up beyond her means.

AITA?

  
Edit: So some additional details have emerged in the days since my post.  Apparently, our club's leader had never even had the opportunity to speak with Jen following my conversation with her.  Instead, Jen was riled up by other group members messaging her following the party, accusing her of taking advantage of the situation.  So when Jen messaged me in the morning, it was on the assumption that I had been going around talking poorly about her, when in reality I'd only expressed my concerns to the club's leadership.

When our club's leader (btw, I say leader because AITA's bot does not like you saying pr3zident) called her following me forwarding the text chain, Jen was amped up for a fight and was hostile from the very second she answered the call.  After a lot great deal of insults and cursing from Jen, our leader then decided that she should no longer be welcome in our group going forward.



Also, some people have expressed concern over why I say ""leader"".  This is because AITA's bot will automatically flag a conversation with pr3zident in it.  My social group is a club with various officers placed there by its members.",Not the A-hole,1hh4wyb

"AITA for kicking out my mom’s boyfriend? When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",Not the A-hole,1ies40z
"AITA For Pointing out my wife acted similar after my SIL's gender reveal? So, my wifes sister is pregnant. She had a gender reveal last Saturday. This is her second baby. Second baby is a boy, first kid is a girl. SIL was kind of disappointed (or surprised, I guess?) about having a boy but, I wouldn't say mad. My wife only has sisters so SIL probably didnt imagine herself raising a boy. 

So anyways right, on the ride back home, my wife was talking about how it was ""Weird""  her sister was so visibly disappointed when the blue came out, but like, she acted the same. She got over it after like a day (or a week) but she still was. We have two daughters, she was hoping for a boy and a girl. She was like, ""We're not talking about me though,"" and I said ""Just pointing it out"" and she responded ""You *always* do that though.""

"AITA for sitting braless in my garden? We are living in a complex, and have a small garden within for ourselves. There are bushes planted by the complex, but they are not super high, so you can see the neighbours in their own garden, and from the shared inner garden-space.

"AITA for refusing to financially support my parents and explaining why when my brother asked? ****Thanks, everyone, for paying attention to this post. I’ve read all the comments, and some of you even shared your own experiences. Honestly, reading through everything and answering some of the questions has felt like free therapy. I really appreciate everyone taking the time to respond.*****


I (38F) have been living in a different state from my family for over 10 years. I’ve supported myself the entire time and rarely asked anyone for help. I didn’t grow up with my parents, my grandmother supported and raised me, and I never had a close relationship with them.

Last year, I went on vacation with my siblings. During the trip, I found out that my youngest brother (29M), who makes the most money out of all of them, has been paying the mortgage and most of our parents’ living expenses. He asked me why I wasn’t helping financially.

Since he asked directly, I answered honestly. I told him that our parents didn’t support me growing up, and that I still remember when my grandmother asked me to write them a letter requesting financial support for my education. My mom wrote back to my grandmother saying she should teach me not to ask them for money because what my dad earned was “just enough” for them and my three siblings. My grandmother let me read that letter, which I don’t think my mom knows.

I told my brother that I contributed financially when we immigrated and that I paid rent when I lived with them for two years. I also used whatever money I earned to help support my grandmother, who actually raised me, until she passed away. After I moved to a different state, I’ve been completely on my own with zero financial help. Because of that history, I didn’t feel responsible for supporting our parents now.

Apparently, my brother told my mom. She confronted me via text and accused me of being “disrespectful” as a child. I explained my side and the experiences that shaped my feelings. She mentioned times she believes I was disrespectful, including verbal and physical conflicts. I explained that these incidents didn’t happen in isolation and were often triggered by her actions, such as trying to persuade my grandmother to send me somewhere to dance for money or deliberately ruining my school uniform by putting soy sauce on it. I told her she had not treated me like a mother should when I was growing up. The conversation didn’t go well, and afterward my mom stopped talking to me. Eventually, the rest of my family did too.

Now I’m basically no contact with all of them. I feel like I told the truth and set a reasonable boundary, but somehow I’m the one who ended up alone. 

AITA for refusing to help financially and explaining my reasons when asked?

INFO:

1. So just to clarify: My siblings paying most of my parents’ mortgage isn’t actually a hardship, the cost is split three ways between two brothers and one sister, and they all still live in my parents’ home. I’ve never lived there and don’t even have a room in that house, so I’m being asked to contribute to a household I was never part of.

Their mortgage is under $2k, which is cheaper than what most people pay for rent right now. My siblings divide that amount based on income, my brother pays the most, and the other two split the rest. They also split utilities and groceries.

My parents also receive fixed income from Social Security, which they use to travel back and forth between two countries. They’re not struggling; they simply want to keep their same lifestyle without adjusting their spending.

I’m married, and we don’t have kids yet. My husband and I set up our finances so either one of us could cover all household expenses alone if necessary. That’s intentional for if I get pregnant, I’d be able to stop working for a while without financial issues.

My parents and siblings see that stability and assume it means I have “extra” money to give them, basically because my husband could support me. 

Realistically, they could sell their house and make a significant amount of money, which would easily support their retirement back in my home country. My siblings are in their late 20s and early 30s, so they’re fully capable of moving out, renting their own places, and building their own independent lives if they wanted to.

But that’s not what they’re choosing to do. Living together is simply cheaper for everyone involved, and it benefits all of them. That’s their choice, but it doesn’t mean I’m required to subsidize it. So no, I don’t think I’m the asshole in this situation, which is why it’s confusing to be treated like I am.

2. Soy sauce was the most accessible thing for her to use because it was one of our main seasonings at home. When I was a teenager, school meant everything to me, it was my escape, and the only path I saw toward a better future. Damaging my uniform wasn’t random; it was the easiest and most effective way for her to hurt me. It was a big deal too because I only had one uniform which means I hand wash it as soon as I get home then let it air dry overnight and wake up early in the morning to iron it. I basically had to hand wash it and dry it using an iron just to make it to school that day. 

Think of it like someone deliberately pouring red wine on a wedding dress, it’s meant to destroy the one thing they know matters most to you.

3. Yes, during that time, “going abroad to dance” is often used as a cover to lure girls into trafficking. It’s presented as legitimate work, but many end up exploited once they get there. I hope that helps clarify it. ",Not the A-hole,1p9joq9
"AITA for sacrificing the guest room instead of the office space? My husband and I live in a 3 bedroom apartment. We sleep in the master bedroom, and until earlier this year, the other two were a guest room and an office space we both shared.

Our first child was born in October, and we decided to turn the guest room into his nursery. We thought about sacrificing the office instead, but decided we needed it more than the guest room. I work on-site, but I also do some freelancing from home, and my husband works hybrid. We don’t need to do our work from the office, but it’s more comfortable and less chaotic, especially now that we have a baby. On the other hand, we rarely have guests over. If we do, the office is big enough to set a mattress ***(edit: a normal one, not an air mattress)*** on the floor.

My father lives in a different country. He’s traveling here for Christmas in about a week, and this will be his first time meeting my son in person. Last time he came, I was pregnant and we still had the guest room, so he stayed there during his visit.

A couple weeks ago, my father called to ask whether he could stay at my apartment again this year. I said sure, but we don’t have the guest room anymore, so he’d have to sleep in the office. He asked what I meant, and I told him we’d turned the guest room into the baby’s nursery.

He then asked why I hadn’t gotten rid of the office instead. I explained my and my husband’s reasoning. My father got annoyed and said, “Whatever, I’ll get a hotel”, before hanging up on me.

The next day, my father texted me. He said it was selfish and inconsiderate of me and my husband to keep an office we “don’t actually need” over a room to properly house potential guests. He added that he didn’t raise me to be such an awful hostess, and it’s insane of me to think people would be okay sleeping on a mattress on the floor.

My sister is siding with my father, and I’m starting to doubt myself here.

"AITA for asking my friend to give back a gift I gave her after she openly expressed that she would be getting rid of it? I (27 F) have been friends with this girl (we'll call her Mary- 28 F) since high-school. Recently I was back in our hometown and she invited me to her birthday brunch to celebrate her 28th b-day. One day on my way home I happened to stumble across an estate sale where I found a set of really nice, crystal champagne glasses that were in really good condition and cheaper than their worth. Mary lives a high quality fancy lifestyle, so I thought they would be perfect for her, especially because they were within my budget (at the time I had been recovering from student loans and just put down a deposit on my first apartment in the city).

Fast forward to the brunch, we had a really good time and I got to catch up with Mary and other friends from high-school. Mary was eager to open the presents, and when she got to mine, she seemed to enjoy them, asking me where I got them since there was no label. I explained that I didn't know the brand, but the person running the estate sale had assured me that they were authentic and had been a wedding gift to the previous owners. At the mention of the estate sale, Mary became visibly disgusted. Although she didn't say anything to my face, she was very passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the afternoon. I overheard her whispering to some of the other guests about how I had the audacity to give her a used item and that she would be discarding them later.

  
After the event was over, I approached her privately, not wanting to make a scene and asked that if she wasn't going to use the glasses, if she could give them back as I would put them to good use and know their quality. She flipped out and told me it was extremely rude to ask for them back and it was not my business what she did with them.

My family is understanding and thinks that I did nothing wrong, but some mutual friends also at the event think otherwise. So, am I the a-hole?",Not the A-hole,1ivwpqc
"AITA for canceling a trip because my friend can’t afford it? I (20f) have a close friend (21f) who has been asking me for months to go to LA for a fun summer trip. Now, we live around 8 hours away so I kinda just assumed we would fly and the other day when she brought it up I told her we should probably book our flights soon. To that she looked really confused and told me how she couldn’t afford plane tickets and she wanted to drive. 

I was sorta confused because if she can’t afford a $150 plane ticket how was she planning to pay for the activities and places SHE wants to go (Nobu, jetskiing, shopping, clubs etc) which all add up quickkk. She also doesn’t have her license which means I would have to do all the driving which would be hard as I have bad back issues and driving for so long would be painful.

She kinda just laughed and said since I have money she assumed I would pay for a majority of her expenses. I was shocked because why would she assume I would pay for her expenses without even asking? I have no problem covering something like drinks or ice cream but to assume I would pay for everything by myself except for the hotel? (we had previously agreed to split the hotel 50/50)

I told her that this trip was her idea and she shouldn’t have asked me to go if she was expecting me to pay for everything. She’s upset and complaining about how it’s unfair since I can afford to pay for her, AITA?

UPDATE! I told her for her to invite me on a trip then assume i’d cover expenses like this was ridiculous. As for now, I’m just gonna cut back and let our friendship fizzle off. We’ve been friends for years but this was childish and out of line. Thanks for all the advice!",Not the A-hole,1kxb3dd
"WIBTA if I don't ""share"" the inheritance that I received from a friend with her daughter? I (F32) recently came into an inheritance when my neighbor and close friend, Valorie (F68), died. I met Valorie when I moved into my condo in 2018 and she became my next door neighbor. Our places are on the top floor and have almost connecting balconies.

We used to spend every Saturday morning outside taking care of our plant babies and chatting. I had learned that Valorie had been a widow since she was 55. I got the impression that she had married young and never had a true chance to learn who she was until after Garry had died.

I had always thought that Valorie was alone in the world. Turns out that Valorie had had one child, a daughter, Sam (F44). However, they had been estranged since the early 2000's. The story that Valorie told me was that Sam had come out as gay when she was just out of high school. That did not sit well with Garry. He told Sam that she was no longer his daughter and kicked her out; telling her to never contact them or come home again. The whole situation broke Valorie's heart and it was her biggest regret in life. She told me that she had always wished she had tried to fight for Sam, but in the moment she was so shocked that she watched the whole thing happen without saying a word.

When I had first heard that story, I asked if she had ever tried to reach out. Valorie told me that she hadn't because she didn't know how to even try. So I did some internet sleuthing and found Sam on Facebook. It turns out that Sam had managed to build a good life for herself.

I helped Valorie draft a heartfelt message to Sam. Valorie apologized for everything and told Sam how much her perspectives had changed over the years. Valorie also asked if they could try and build a new relationship. We sent the message and saw that Sam had seen and maybe read the message, but Sam never responded.

About a month ago, I got home from work to find Valorie passed away on her balcony. She had suffered an embolism. I sent the link to her obituary and memorial page to Sam. I didn't see Sam at the funeral. There is a lawyer handling all of Valorie's affairs. I thought that I would simple grieve the loss of my friend and eventually would have a new neighbor.

I never expected me to be the only person who Valorie mentioned in her will. Let alone to have been left everything.

A few days ago Sam messaged me. She was upset and demanded that I give her Valorie's things. Claiming that I took advantage of an old widow. I was upset when I first read Sam's message and thought, ""who does she think she is? She hasn't spoken to Valorie in literal decades and never responded when Valorie tried to reach out. Now Valorie is her mother and that entitles her to Valorie's stuff?""

Now I wonder if I should do something for Sam. I go back and forth if Valorie would want me to. Valorie knew where Sam was, so she could have included Sam somehow.

The lawyer I talked to said that the inheritance is completely mine and that Sam has no claim, but should I give Sam something?

UPDATE:

Thank you to everyone who has commented and giving me the outside perspective that I needed. I'm shocked at the volume of people who have reacted to this. I was really only hoping to have a handful of responses to help me think. I do want to clarify some things that I wasn't able to in the original post due to the character limits.

I first want to address the timeline of events:

* Sam was kicked out in the early 2000's. I think it was in 2002.
* Garry died in 2011.
* Valorie sold the ""family home"" and downsized to her condo in 2013, because the house was too big for just her.
* I moved in to my condo in 2018.
* I learned about Sam, Valorie wrote the letter, and we sent it to Sam in 2022.
* Valorie retired and had her will and estate set up in the end of 2023.
* Valorie died on January 23, 2025.
* The funereal was on January 31, 2025. I messaged Sam as soon as the funeral arrangements were finalized.
* Sam messaged me this past Sunday on February 23, 2025.

To clarify some questions that people had about the estate. It's currently in the formal probate process. Valorie was a legal secretary for a family law office and the lawyer she worked with specialized in estate law. She had a full carrier there and as part of her retirement package that lawyer helped her set up her will and take care of the estate. This is the lawyer who told me that everything is being done by the book, that everything will be fully settled in a few months, and that all of Valorie's wishes are being carried out to the letter.

I have taken reddit's advice and will be speaking to a different lawyer about both my legal interests in the estate and how to communicate with Sam. I still haven't responded to her, because I haven't been sure how. Her initial message was extremely harsh and attacking and that is what triggered that first emotional and protective response in me. I'm trying to take reddit's advice and be empathetic to Sam's situation. However, that is challenging because Sam has continued to send me a few additional messages demanding that I respond and calling me a ""heartless bitch"" and ""homophobic bigot"" among other things. I'm not going to respond until after I've talked to that lawyer and can do it in the right way.

I do think that reddit is right and that if Sam wants any sentimental items that she should have them because they might help her healing. I do want to be clear that the estate is not very big and is very simple. All that Valorie had was her condo and her car. That car was more valuable to her than it is on the market. It's a 2014 model of a daily-driver.

I hold the spare key to Valories condo and have been in to clear out the kitchen and to take care of her plant babies, because I can't bare to see them die too. It's been really strange being in that space without her. I've been given permission start cleaning out the condo, but not to get rid of anything. I'm going to spend this weekend going threw her things and organizing them into boxes. I don't know what type of sentimental item's that I'll find, because Valorie doesn't have any family photos on display in her place. There are no photos of Sam and no photos of Garry; not even wedding photos.

I can't speak to the Valorie who Sam knew. I do know that in her younger years Valorie was an active member of the LDS church, but that she had stopped being religious by the time that I knew her. The Valorie who I knew was by no means a bigot. I knew her as a kind, loving, and accepting person. She knew that I'm bi and never judged me for it. She has a Pride flag hanging on her balcony and she used to attend Pride parades as one of those ally moms/grandmas who would hug and be supportive to the LGBTQ+ youth who had no one. I knew her has someone who was trying to make amends to the universe. When I first heard the story about Sam I was shocked because that just didn't line up with the Valorie that I knew.

Valorie did have her own Facebook account and knew how to use it, but Sam was not easy to find. It took me a few months to track her down. We used Facebook Messenger because that was our only means of contacting Sam. The ""message"" was a 4-5 page letter where Valorie told Sam everything and completely shared her sole. Valorie only reached out once because, ""Sam was so much like her father and I don't want to push her or hurt her further by pestering. I've told her everything I can until she responds.""

The only direct communication that I've had with Sam was the Facebook messages I sent her about Valorie's death.

I think that covered everyone's questions. Thank you all for providing me with new perspectives, it's been helpful. There's been interested in all of this, so if people want any further updates after probate I'll try and provide them.

UPDATE: 

I met with a lawyer last week and learned some new things. Firstly, that lawyer is going to reaching out to Sam to ask her to stop contacting me directly and to only communicate via him or the probate process. He's also going to ask her what she wants, both from Valorie and what her goal was for contacting me directly. 

This lawyer also explained the formal probate process for my area for me. Legal next of kin only have during the formal probate process to file a contest against a will. Once the process is finished there is no legal way to contest the will. One of the steps of this process is also to legally/officially notify all next of kin and debtors of the death and that the estate is in the formal process. So, Sam was notified by the probate attorneys right around the time that she sent me that first message on Facebook. What's strange is that the probate documentation shows that Sam said she doesn't want anything from Valorie. 

My lawyer also told me that the way Valorie's will was written it would have been challenging for Sam to contest it during the formal probate process. He also said that it was extremely rare for judges to rule against the deceased's wishes; especially when it was easy to prove that those wishes were made when the person was of full sound mind and body. He also added that Sam telling probate that she didn't want anything from Valorie and her harassment style to contacting me would all add additional layers of challenge if she does change her mind and files a contest in court. 

So now I'm waiting to hear back from Sam. I'm now very curious as to why she would tell the probate attorneys that she didn't want anything, but would then turn around and contact me the way she did. ",Not the A-hole,1iy29sn
"AITA for telling my DIL that I will never be her mother and to leave me alone This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.

My issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.

There have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.

I’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.

This is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).

Somehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. 

My son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.

"AITAH for kicking out my friend's neurodivergent friend, for what I felt was ignoring boundaries and touching my most personal stuff? I'm just super annoyed that I'm made to be the bad guy but in case I'm missing something, here it is. 

My friends have a buddy (uses pronouns they/them), they bring along who is on the spectrum and high-functioning. They can drive, live independently, clearly make friends, and hold down a job - so personally, I think they can understand and respect boundaries. 

They have this annoying and disgusting habit of burping really hard, effortfully, so it is loud. And I have a sensitive nose and it smells. I don't care they do that but when it's in my literal personal space, less than three feet, that's an issue. 

I told them several times not to do that when they are literally facing me and talking to me, facing me, or eating right next to me, with an entire plate of food being passed around. 

The end of my patience was then met when I had a gathering and they invited them. They (their friend), came in and I was warm to them, then when I go to the bathroom, I come back looking for them to tell them we are eating dinner. Lo and behold they are playing with my hearing aids I put in a device to dry them out since it was raining.  (My friends just speak louder around me when they are off)

I literally need those for work and my safety, and other people playing with, let alone wearing them, is unsanitary. 

I flipped out and told them to put those down and he burped in my face, laughing, saying they was sorry and tried to hug me. They drop one of my hearing aids on the floor and almost spill their drink on it, the puddle barely touching it as I grabbed it. 

These are $3000 each...

I told them to let go and my friends were trying to get me to understand that they has trouble with these social cues. My response was:

  
""I'm allowed to decide what I put up with in my personal space and who handles my medical devces. Anybody who can hold down a job, make friends, and live alone should be able to respect boundaries. I don't care if they're on the spectrum, that doesn't mean anything on this.""

"AITA for planning international travel without my children? So here's the reality.

I have two kids. They are now 14 and 16. I've had 50/50 since I got divorced, up until a few months ago.

4 years ago, my ex wife got remarried and her husband advised her to start a custody dispute.

I spent $165,000 (basically my life savings) fighting for 4 years. For the record, my ex-wife's father is wealthy and paid all her legal fees. (This comes in to play later) The older child told the court appointed therapist ""I want to live with mom and only see Dad every other weekend"". The younger one just said they wanted to do 50/50.

The younger one then changed their mind and said: ""Oh maybe 70/30 with Mom. I just want court stuff to be over.""

I went to trial. My attorney fought like hell, but the judge said: ""Given the children's age, their preference will take precedence and we won't split them up, as it break their sibling bond.""

Well, my wife and I have been planning some travel with some of her friends, her sister and their husbands. It includes 9 days in Spain and France. They picked the dates. We got tickets. The kids found out about it and have been asking me: ""We want to go. Why can't we go?""

I told my children: ""This is something we planned. We saved for.""

"AITA for not claiming my friends mistake on my insurance Hi! I (26F) and my friend from college (26F) both moved into the same apartment building. She lives on the floor above mine. One weekend she put me along with a bunch of our mutual friends in a group chat because she wanted to have a barbecue on our roof. She has hosted many before, but this would be the first one I ever attended. Because I don’t eat red meat I did not eat anything that was cooked on the grill and only brought chips a bottle and paper plates. When the day was over, the group of us went downstairs to watch a reality show. My friend who lives in my building and the girl who owned the grill discussed that they would leave the grill to cool off. Once the reality show it was over, I went back to my apartment and went to sleep.

The next day everyone in my building receives an email saying that there was a fire on the roof last night because someone dumped coals in the trashcan on the roof and they re-lit due to the wind. I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to my friend who then put it in the group chat of everyone. her and our other friend, who owned the grill, told us that they decided to take the grill home the same day because they didn’t wanna have to come back and get it the next day. So the girl in my building gave the grill owner her keys to go get the grill on the roof and the grill owner decided that it would be the best thing to just toss the coals into the trashcan on the roof. Our building requires multiple key taps to get on and off the roof and they also have cameras so they immediately told  my friend in my building she was responsible since it was her guest using her keys.

A week later, my friend came to me and asked me to put it on my insurance since she nor the grill owner, had renters insurance. I spoke with a few lawyers and my old insurance agent, and they all said that this would be fraud. So I told my friend I did not feel comfortable doing so. Another week goes by and she asked me again because she believed that she would have to go bankrupt over the situation (she did not). I again said no because I did not feel comfortable and reiterated that I was told that this would be fraud.

From then, she started to run a smear campaign, saying that I was the bad friend and all of our friend group stop talking to me because they said that I should’ve at least tried to put it on my insurance. They now all want me to apologize to all of them and work for their friendship again since they believe that I was in the wrong but I feel like I didn’t do any wrong. So WITA?",Not the A-hole,1kwoqim
"AITA For Not Letting A Woman Cut The Line At The Grocery Store?  Hi Reddit. I need your opinion on grocery store etiquette and not letting someone cut the line. Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

So Reddit, am I the Asshole for not letting this woman cut in front of me and calling her out when she tried to use ""Christmas Spirit"" to get her way",Not the A-hole,1hi5pmy
"AITA for telling my mom why she had kids? I (17F) am still in high school and live in an area where it’s really hard to get a job. I don’t have a car because there’s no money for driving school.

Recently, my mom (37) told me she’s not going to buy food anymore because “we’re all grown” and everyone has to buy their own food. This started after she asked my brother (19), who works and also gets to use her car to get to work, to give her $100 to buy food since we rely on SNAP and the government shut it down. He refused, so she decided she’s not buying food for anyone and that everyone has to fend for themselves.

I completely lost it when she told me this and said, “Why did you even have kids? Why have kids if you’re poor and just end up regretting them?” She always talks about how we ruined her life, so I just snapped. I asked why, at 17, broke and having to take care of her own family, she decided to have kids anyway. Kids that she trauma dumps on every chance she gets. She always lets my brother have his way and then gets mad at the rest of us.


In the heat of the argument, I also told her that if she really didn’t want us, she should’ve just aborted us or never had us in the first place. I said that if she really wanted to punish someone, it should be my brother, since he’s the one who refused to help in the first place. She went on to say, “ I should have” “You guys are grown. I already raised you. I already raised you.”


I know what I said was rude and disrespectful, but it’s just so hard not to be when I’m this angry and hurt.

"AITA, My roommates mom banged on my door when I had a guy over and said “shut the fuck up” I (F19) live in a college apartment with 3 other roommates. The roommate who lives right next to me (F19) had her mom stay the weekend with her in her room. Tonight I had a guy over and nothing crazy happened, around 5am we started to fool around. The mom then bangs on my door and says “Can yall shut the fuck up”. Mind you we aren’t making much noise, all we are really doing is making out, no sex. Also in the past when I’ve had company I’ve asked my roommate if she could hear me and my guests and she has said that she can’t hear us. So am I the asshole for having a guy over and making noise while her mom is staying over?


Edit: Since a lot of people are commenting it, yes we were probably a tad bit louder than I had originally thought, but there definitely wasn’t any extreme moaning or super egregious sounds (no bed or walls shaking). I was mostly taken aback by how she approached me. But it’s on me for making noise, from now on I will definitely be more cautious of bringing guests when my roommate has her parents.",Not the A-hole,1j75s2v
"AITA For Asking Why My Co-Worker Wears Makeup Everyday? Howdy howdy, never posted here, throwaway account, yadda yadda yadda.

So I (29M) was at work during a pretty long meeting with a few other co-workers. One of my co-workers is new (late 30s F) and the conversation steered around our professional experiences and history. Pretty standard I guess.

Midway during reviewing some boring stuff this co-worker asked me with a smirk, « Can I ask you a question ? ». Since we were talking about our professional lives I was like « yeah sure what’s up? », and she followed up with why do you always wear hats?

Now, I’ll be honest I’m bald, however I like my baldness. I started balding at 21 and I was like, fuck that, and just shaved it off instead of trying to style my hair in anyway to hide it. Also since my hair is super curly and compact it just wasn’t gonna be an option. In college people loved it, said I had a good head shape and said I looked like Terry Crews, Shaquille O’Neal or The Rock (not sure about that last one lol) so I was pretty confident with it.

But when I turned 25 I started being mistaken for 30 cause of the bald cut so I started wearing hats pretty much everywhere. Grew a collection for all situations, work, gym, social life. Anywhere besides weddings and funerals tbh. And with hats on at 29 I’ve been mistaken to be as young as 22 (not the goal but yeah). The plan was to wear them until 30 and then cut back when my head matched my age lol

Anyways, this co-worker asks « why do you wear hats everyday? » to be fair it’s a corporate setting but it’s also tech, we’re in marketing and it’s 2025 so smart-casual is the rule of thumb and my bosses don’t care and dress in hoodies and hats to work some days.

I responded « I like hats » and she said « but everyday? », so I said « yeah I’m bald, I like my headshape but I don’t wanna look like I’m 35 so I’ll wear hats for now, plus I look good in them! ». Now I wasn’t thinking and she’s probably around this 35 age or older so I may have offended her with that but she replied « 29 and wearing hats everyday to hide? Wow »

This truck a nerve with me so I responded « Well since joining I’ve seen you wear makeup everyday, even casual Fridays or on your work from home team calls, so why do YOU wear makeup everyday? » there was a muffled giggle but it’s clear the atmosphere was tense.

She got heated and said « that’s a sexist question » and I said « How? Other women in the office don’t wear makeup everyday and my boyfriend sometimes wears makeup when we go out to a high class event. He just doesn’t do it everyday. So why do you wear makeup everyday? »

She got heated and silent and one of the other co-workers went back to focusing on the deck. I feel like her and I not on the best of terms now as she will not talk to me now.

"AITA for not bringing anything to my friend’s potluck after she told me not to? One of my close friends hosted a dinner at her place last weekend. She called it a “potluck” and sent a group text saying we should each bring a little something, drinks, snacks, whatever. It wasn’t anything fancy, just casual. I asked her what I should bring and mentioned I’d be coming straight from work and might be a little rushed. She replied that I didn’t need to worry about it, she had plenty of food and just wanted me to come.

So I didn’t bring anything. I showed up, said hi to everyone, and honestly, the night was going fine. People brought stuff, a salad, some cupcakes, a couple bottles of wine. I was planning to just help clean up or do dishes since I didn’t bring anything, and I figured she meant what she said.

But later on, while people were complimenting the food, she made this offhand comment like, “Well, not everyone contributed… but we’re still glad she showed up.” Everyone laughed, and it didn’t seem super serious, but I felt my face get hot. I didn’t know how to respond.

I stayed polite and tried not to act weird about it, but I felt uncomfortable the rest of the night. On the way home, I kept thinking about it. I get that maybe she was a little annoyed, but she literally told me not to bring anything. And now I feel like she put me on blast in front of people for something I didn’t even do wrong.

I haven’t said anything to her yet because it feels small and I don’t want to be dramatic, but I also can’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t fair.

"AITA for not following my husband's family tradition? My (28f) husband (29m) comes from a very traditional family. While we disagree with his family on many things, it has never really been an issue until now.

I am currently 8 months pregnant and my husband and I couldn't be happier as we've been trying for a while. Since I first found out I was pregnant, we've been discussing names for our child. In my husband's family, the tradition wants the child to be named after his grandfather. Basically, first-born men in his family only have one of two names: James or Henry. My husband's grandfather was James, so his name is James too. My husband's father is called Henry, so our child should be too. And so on and so forth.

But my husband and I didn't really feel like calling our child Henry, and although it's a beautiful way to honor family members, we really wanted our child to have a name that would be personal, that would truly be his. So we chose another name, and decided to wait until after the birth to reveal it to everyone.

This week, my mother in law came to visit us and help us set up for the baby. She brought us some presents, amongst which was a bunch of clothes on which she hand embroidered the name Henry. I said that it was nice and thanked her for it, but told her that we wouldn't be naming our child Henry, as we had already told her in the past. She started insisting and saying that it was a tradition so it had to be that way. I explained to her that we'd rather give our child a name that we chose, and that Henry could be his middle name.

She immediately went to my husband and started saying things like ""you're not going to let her do that to our family"" and making it very dramatic, saying that I was breaking a tradition that went back hundreds of years (honestly not sure about that). My husband tried to explain that we both agreed on the name, and all the reasons why we made that choice, but she wouldn't listen. She suggested that we names him Henry on paper, as his legal name, and then called him something else, but I thought that would be confusing for him and told her that he would be named what we chose.

She kept begging my husband and saying that I was ruining the family tradition, and at one point I lost it (which is partially to blame on hormones I think) and told her that it was our child, so we did what we wanted, and we didn't have to follow a stupid tradition. She stormed out and my husband has since received texts from his father and sister accusing me of making his mother feel really bad and some other stuff that I don't really remember.

I get the importance of tradition and it can be really beautiful, but also I feel like that shouldn't be an obligation and it's okay to change things. We won't change our baby's name because we're really set on that, but maybe we were wrong for not following the tradition? I'm not entirely sure, and am mentally exhausted by all this drama...

  
Edit: I've seen many comments mentioning they saw similar stories in the past. I'd like to clarify: those weren't mine, all of those events happened two days ago. But it's crazy to see how many families have similar traditions, I really thought this was a super rare thing! ",Not the A-hole,1jgeljt
"AITA for uninviting my sister-in-law from my wedding after she leaked my pregnancy? I (26F) am 10 weeks pregnant. My partner (28M) and I told our immediate families early but made it VERY clear we weren't telling anyone else until after the first trimester.

"AITA for refusing to reimburse my friend for a chair that broke under me? I (F25) was at a friend’s house for a game night this past weekend with a group of about 6. Everyone brought food and drinks and we were having a good time, when about halfway through the night I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back, I saw that one of the girls had moved from a chair to the side to my space on the couch. This didn’t bug me as people shuffle around in groups, so whatever. The chair was an antique wooden chair that sat a bit lower to the ground with an added back/butt cushion. When I sat down it immediately broke, sending me to the ground with the seat under me and the arm frames falling to the side.

Everyone got quiet for a second before jumping up to help me. I wasn’t hurt, just very embarrassed. For context I’m a bigger girl, about 260 pounds at 5 foot 7 inches. My friend (F27) was very gracious and nice about it when it happened, accepting my apologies and telling me not to worry. Her boyfriend (M29) said that the chair was his grandmother’s and it has fallen apart before and he was able to repair it. I was ushered back to the couch and game night continued.

Fast forward to the next morning, I received a text from my friend who let me know that the chair couldn’t be put back together, and that from her research it would cost about $250 to get a new one, but she’d let me know exactly how much when she found one. I was a bit taken aback, and responded confused, asking why I would be expected to pay for a faulty chair. She said that while yes, on occasion the frames would become unattached and cause it to fall apart, but that that’s not what happened this time. She sent me pictures of the broken chair, particularly a bent support and 2 other broken supports. She said that the chair broke under my weight and couldn’t be fixed, and since the chair was an antique from her boyfriend’s late grandmother, she wanted a new one for him.

I responded that the chair was very old and had a history of collapsing. If they were concerned about preserving it, they should’ve not had it out for people to use, and $250+ for a chair I sat in for 1 second seems a bit ridiculous. At this point she seemingly got frustrated, and said that she loves me but that I’m her “biggest friend” and that it wouldn’t have happened to anyone else. She said: “It broke from your weight plopping down all at once, not because the frame was loose. I think it’s only fair you reimburse us for the chair since you’re responsible for breaking it.”

I’m still figuring out how to respond. I don’t want to pay her for something I don’t see as being completely my fault. I also think she’s using the scenario to shame me about my weight a bit, which I find frustrating. My friends’ opinions are mixed. A few are saying that I should just pay her and move on, even if it’s not exactly my fault. One thinks it is my fault and I should pay up, and a few more think she’s in the wrong for asking and I should continue to politely decline. AITA for refusing to pay?",Not the A-hole,1n607gu
"AITA for making my friend walk home after he insulted my cooking?

 I (27M) hosted a small dinner at my place for a few friends last weekend. I’m no professional chef, but I enjoy cooking, and I spent hours prepping a nice meal. Everyone seemed to like it, except for my friend “Mark” (28M).

From the moment he sat down, Mark kept making little comments like, “Did you forget to season this?” or “This is why I stick to takeout.” At first, I laughed it off, but he wouldn’t stop. Eventually, he said something like, “Man, even a frozen pizza would’ve been better than this.”

That was the last straw for me. I told him, “If you hate it so much, maybe you should just leave.” He laughed, thinking I was joking, but I wasn’t. I made it clear he wasn’t welcome to stay if he was going to keep insulting me.

He ended up leaving, but since he didn’t drive, he had to walk home (about 20 minutes). Now, a few friends are saying I overreacted and that kicking him out was too harsh, while others think he deserved it. Mark texted me later, calling me “petty” and saying I made him feel humiliated.

"AITA refusing to ban alcohol from Christmas?  We have a large mix family. My wife is Mexican so her family starts dropping in on Christmas Eve and we host them and my family Christmas day for dinner. It could be over 50 people in and out of our house in those two days. There’s lots of mixing of cultures because who doesn’t want tequila and tamales.  I’m often gifted drinks and my wife likes wine. 

My older brother Mike started dating this new woman who has children.  I’ll call her Jenny. Jenny wants to bring her 3 children that I have only met briefly over the summer. But she said her children are not allowed around people who drink. So now Mike wants me to ban all alcohol at Christmas from my house. My mother backs him up saying it’s unnecessary to have all those people around children even though I have 2 of my own and my children love the loud bustling house at Christmas and playing with their cousins.  These no other children on my side of the family so Jenny’s children “like my family” and need to adjust my holiday to make Jenny and them feel welcome. 

Another issue I was told to talk about my kids is Santa. Santa wasn’t really a thing in my wife’s culture so we did away with it before my wife felt like the whole naughty and nice thing with Santa doesn’t go with her Mexican Catholic roots so Santa is more of symbol of Christmas for my children and the cousins. 

I understand that Jenny is really into Santa and Elf on the Shelf. My children are 5 &amp; 8 and Jenny’s are 4-10 and I don’t know how my children or their cousins would react to all of that if it was brought up. I said maybe next year maybe my mom could host our family’s Christmas or my brother and Jenny could (if they are still together) but I don’t feel like setting rules in my house about tequila and making kids pretend Santa and elf on the self is real or talk to their cousins about it. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen so I think Jenny and her kids should stay at home. ",Not the A-hole,1hjfuhg
"AITA for ruining my SIL's birthday by crying? I (43M) am an Advanced Paramedic in Critical Care. This means I’m trained to treat very serious injury and illness, and also work in my service’s Emergency Operations Centre to monitor emergency calls and dispatch other AP-CCs. Because it’s a high-stress job and my shifts can easily overrun, I usually only commit to social events on my days off.

Recently, my SIL (40F) booked a meal at a nice restaurant to celebrate her birthday. I initially told my partner (44M) I couldn’t go as I had a 6am-4pm shift that day. However, he really wanted me to go, so I got my shift changed from Ambulance Crew to EOC, thinking it would decrease the chance of being too late or too drained to go.

The shift was awful - my country’s healthcare system is extremely overburdened and I had to make a lot of difficult decisions prioritising calls. Near the end of my shift, I had to input on a complex, distressing call which took almost 2 hours. I left work 90 mins late and got to the restaurant about 20 mins late, in uniform and very tired.

When I arrived, SIL sarcastically said it was nice of me to finally show up and to make such an effort with my clothes. I apologised, saying I had a call that overran. My partner asked about the call, and I said I didn’t want to discuss it as it was upsetting and probably inappropriate for SIL’s daughter (8F) to hear. BIL (38M) said it was just a call and I wasn’t actually there, so if I’m going to use it as an excuse to disrespect his wife I should tell them what happened. I said it wasn’t an excuse, I couldn’t just hang up emergency calls when I felt like it, and SIL said I shouldn’t have taken the call when I knew I had to leave. I said I was the only AP on duty so what was I supposed to do, make a junior dispatcher do my job for me? SIL said not everything was about me or how important and special my job is, especially not her birthday.

I was honestly so overwhelmed I started crying, although I know it was probably an overreaction. I was also really embarrassed as I don’t cry in front of others, so I went to the toilet to calm down. My partner came to check on me and I said I just wanted to go home. He said it was fine, he would explain to SIL and BIL, so I left.

When he got home later, he said SIL and BIL were furious that I’d ruined the meal by making it about me, as they felt I should have made sure I was on time and out of uniform, or at least been more understanding about why SIL was upset. I said SIL made it about me by being rude over a 20 min delay when I was clearly exhausted, and he said I couldn’t expect others to manage my stress for me when I chose a high-stress job. I said I *was* managing my stress when I said I couldn’t go, and he said he also has a stressful job and still doesn’t use it as an excuse to flake on his family.

He wants me to apologise to SIL, and I’m still hurt over the situation. However, I feel really bad for ruining the meal, and I’m worried I did overreact and make everybody cater to my emotions. AITA?

"AITA for feeding my family a fish dinner while I eat steak and potatoes So apparently we don’t get many characters so I’ll try my best to make this short and simple and straight to the point. 

I am three months pregnant and almost everyday I’ve been craving steak and sour cream baked potatoes. I never really cared for steak I’m more of a chicken fingers and fries girlie but I’m guessing the baby must’ve loved steak in its past life because that literally all I crave when I don’t even care for it. 
Today I made my family baked pizza spaghetti with fried catfish a lunch eat salad (salad with chopped deli meat) and dinner rolls. I of course am making the same dish I’ve been eating for almost everyday these last few months. I pretty much make 2 separate meals each night for my cravings. 

Last night after I served the kids and was getting ready to make my finances plate he expressed he wanted steak and potatoes like me. Mind you he was aware of the menu because I have my meals planned night before . I told him I only had that one steak for me. He said “ well we can share” I politely told him that I will need to eat all of my food since I am feeding for two and this is all I have for the night knowing I’ll most likely still be hungry whilst you guys have a meal you can come back for seconds. I am now, in his words a “selfish woman using pregnancy as an excuse to be selfish”. I asked what’s different about today than all the other days when I’ve been literally eating the same shit almost everyday with no complaints? He said nothing but shook his head and said “ it’s the principle bae” and just walked off. We’ve barely spoken since. Just a dry good morning and goodbyes. AITA?

"WIBTA if I kick my boyfriend's sister out our house? Obligatory ""this is a throwaway account"", I don't really use Reddit that much but don't want people I know finding this. 

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for three years and he moved in with me last year. Everything was going great until last Christmas when his parents announced they were selling the family home, and downsizing but they wanted to go on one of those six month long cruises around the world. Fine, whatever they can do what they want except they have a younger daughter ""Emma"" who is 18. Completely unbeknownst to me, my boyfriend had agreed to let Emma live with us until she moved away to uni. This led to a lot of fights between my boyfriend and I because I didn't want Emma living with us. Despite all this, she moved in after the house sold in February. 

It has been hell. For starters, our house might have three bedrooms but only one was used as a bedroom. One is my home and the other was a home gym for me and my boyfriend. Emma turned the gym into her room and now a lot of our equipment is in storage. I hate having Emma here as she's a total brat and doesn't contribute anything to the house. Here is just a small list of shit I have to deal with:

- the second Emma turned 18 she was out with friends, coming back drunk at 3am and waking up my dogs as she clattered into the house, normally with an equally drunk friend. 

- for the first month of her living with us she would steal my stuff constantly. Skincare, haircare, perfume, clothes. Anything. I now have a lockable box for toiletries so she can't get to them. 

- has lost six different sets of house keys since moving in and I've had to have the lock changed twice due to various issues. 

- refuses to do anything I ask her to do because she's ""busy"" SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB. HOW IS SHE BUSY??

- refuses to eat anything I cook and will demand we order takeaway instead. I have asked her repeatedly for meals ideas and even if I make that exact meal, she refuses to eat it as ""it doesn't taste right"". 

The breaking point came last weekend when me, my boyfriend and the dogs went away for the weekend. I was reluctant to leave Emma in the house by herself but my boyfriend said it would be a great way for Emma to gain some independence before going to uni. Big fucking mistake. We came back in Sunday evening to a trashed house and a hungover Emma asleep in her room. I had to get a professional cleaner in on Monday to tackle the worst of the mess after I spent half the night cleaning. 

I'm done. I want her out the house. I thought I could deal with this until she moved away in September but I can't, especially now that she's talking about putting her place on hold for a year so she can go travelling and use our house as a base. No, I want her gone and out asap. True, she has nowhere to go as her parents aren't back from their cruise until the end of August but I don't care. I want her gone. 

I've talked to my boyfriend about this and he won't budge because Emma is family and he can't kick her out. So WIBTA if I kick her out??? 

Edit: Forgot to mention this in the post/maybe it wasn't clear. It's my house. I own it outright with no mortgage and my boyfriend is not on any official documents. The only thing in his name is our Sky TV payments. Everything else is in my name as I lived here before he moved in. He does pay half towards bills but he just sends the money to me each month. 

I'm going to try and talk to Emma and boyfriend's parents. I've sent them a text message asking to call me asap. I'm also reaching out to Emma and my boyfriend's older sister to see if she will take Emma in for a while. I doubt she will as they don't get along and she has a two year old but it's worth a shot. 

Edit Two: I AM SUCH A GODDAMN IDIOT. 

Firstly, thanks to all of the comments I have realised that my boyfriend is not the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with. 

Secondly, I managed to have a video call with my boyfriends parents and wow, just wow. First of all, THEY HAVE BEEN SENDING EMMA £700 A MONTH TO COVER HER LIVING WITH US AND I HAVEN'T SEEN A PENNY OF IT. Their mum mentioned that I could take the cleaner fee out of Emma's money and I asked what money she meant because Emma doesn't have a job. She laughed and said ""The £700 we send Emma each month to cover all her expenses while she lives with you."" They've been sending Emma money and she was supposed to be giving this money to us to cover everything. Either Emma has been keeping it or she's given it to my boyfriend and he hasn't said a word. 

Surprisingly her parents were furious that I haven't seen any of this money and they are sending me a bank transfer of £4200 to cover the money Emma should have been giving us since February. They are sending it to my personal account then I can do with what I see fit. 

I was brutally honest on the call and said that I can't have Emma staying with us any longer. Yes, she might leave in September but what if she doesn't get the results she needs for uni and has to defer or if she takes a gap year. I'm not putting up with this for another year. Their mum is going to talk to her sister and see if Emma can stay there until they get back at the end of August. 

For those wondering, yes they have a house all lined up for when they return. They will not be living with us when they get back. 

I'm going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend this evening and I'm now rethinking our whole relationship. If he tries to fight over Emma staying then it's over. A lot of the comments in this post have made me realise that I've been a doormat to this man since Emma moved in (also that I should have been charging him rent) and I'm not standing for it any more.

"AITA for kicking out a family that gatecrashed a private party? I booked a soft play for my son's birthday party. It has both public sessions and private sessions, I obviously booked one of the private sessions and didn't interfere with the usual times it's available 'to the public'.

When I opened the buffet, a woman I didn't know approached me, asking if her children could have some. I explained I had booked the venue for a private party, she said 'that doesn't matter, my children want some food'. I replied no because the food was for the party.

She walked away telling her children to just wait until I had left the food area. Realising she wasn't taking my answer, I asked staff to speak to her. 

They did, explaining it was a private event and they needed to leave. She shouted that her and her children were not leaving and that I should be told to allow the children to have the food.

I went back over, said again it was a private event, and she shouted 'what is a sandwich?!' repeatedly at me, until I shouted back that she needed to leave.

She did eventually leave, 'flicking the Vs' at me as she walked out the door.

The soft play wasn't at capacity, and in truth, there probably was enough for them to have some of the buffet, but the way she approached me with the assumption I'd say yes, and then blatantly planning to disregard my answer made me stand my ground.

So AITA for kicking out the gatecrashers?

EDIT:
OK so first of all, I did not expect this to literally blow up the way it has... I thought a couple of people would say yes or no, and that would be it 😅

Apolgies for the long edit, but there's been a few 'themes' within comments, so I'll try to address them;

- A soft play is a massive indoor climbing frame covered in padding and safety nets, with slides and ball pits etc. I think some may call it a 'jungle gym' but I'm not sure that is a direct comparison

- 'flicking the Vs' is a peace sign but showing the back of your hand. About the same level of rude as giving the middle finger in the UK

- The venue shares a desk with an adjoining spots hall, which wasn't running open sessions as it was hosting a game. Past the desk is the exit, (it's one door in, one door out thing) door 1 to the soft play, door 2 to the sports hall. I found out later she had come to use the sports hall and was told about the game. Staff thought she went out the exit

- I've spoken to the venue about her being able to get in, and they apologised and are changing how they operate the private sessions. Despite this happening, I think the place has appropriate security measures. I think she took advantage of staff being busy letting in spectators to the sports hall and tried her luck. As we have an invite for a party here in a few weeks, I'll know if they do and can raise it again if needed, but hopefully won't need to

- I went back over when the staff member was talking to her because I felt bad that I put a young girl in the firing line. This woman was just shouting that she wasn't leaving, and I also hadn't spotted them come in, but I should have let her/her manager sort it

- This is in the UK. This wasn't a food stamps have been taken and 'chance a free meal or starve tonight' situation. When she eventually left she brought snacks out of the over priced vending machine. That obviously doesn't tell any of us her full story, but the venue has like 10 places with a few minutes walk where much more affordable snacks and food choices are

- Some people asked about the kids ages. Top age of an invited child was 5. Her two kids were 8/9 and 9/10

- I replied to a couple of comments that I would have told her the kids could have some after all the guests had eaten, if it had been a question and not a demand. I am responsible for my actions, but they were influenced by hers, and I am glad I stood my ground and wasn't bullied at my own event, although not proud that I did shout at the end

Again, I didn't expect this would get so much attention, but to those who were polite and asked questions, thank you.

To anyone who asked 'why are you even asking?' or similar, I was asking to gauge if I was unreasonable for standing my ground because of her actions/reactions. Maybe this was the wrong sub, I'm not very reddit savvy, apologies if I put it in the wrong place...

And for anyone who thinks I made it up... I don't know what to tell you... it happened, and I'm glad you've not encountered a similar experience before and/or can't believe it",Not the A-hole,1om2k64
"AITA for telling my wife she can’t cook? I (29m) have been with my wife (28f) for 8 years, and meals are just about the only place of contention in our marriage, but I’m scared she’s going to kill someone one day.

Background - we split the cooking in our house 50/50, but when she cooks I feel like I have to watch her like a hawk. She undercooks just about everything, especially meat, and no matter how many times I try to politely correct her, she claims I’m being “picky”. 

For example, every time she makes rice, I just can’t convince her it’s 1 part rice to 2 parts water. She always says “are you sure? That seems like a lot of water.” Or “Maybe that’s how you like it, but I don’t want it so mushy”. The package and google won’t convince her either, and I just swallow my pride and eat the crunchy rice every time. It’s like that with everything. Pasta, veggies, bread, meat…

The thing is, I wouldn’t care so much if it was just me, but she always wants to cook for our friends. She really prides herself on her cooking and wants to make everything herself. I just trail behind her, trying to make sure it’s all edible, but there’s usually a few dishes that end up drastically over salted or undercooked. Our friends will politely eat, but I noticed they’ve been coming to fewer and fewer invitations for dinner.

Things all came to a head the other night when she went to put some chicken in the oven as I was hopping in the shower. When I came out, she had pulled the chicken out and said dinner was ready. I was skeptical and told her that it had only been like 10 minutes. She said she pan-seared it first so it was fine, but when I came to look, the sides were literally pink.

I snapped a little and told her she’s going to kill someone one day from serving them raw meat. Can’t you see that it’s pink? That’s food safety number 1. She said she thought it was done, and it’s not her fault, her mother never showed her how to cook chicken growing up. I then told her “Well you’re almost thirty, that’s no excuse for not knowing how to cook at all.”

Needless to say she was pretty upset with me, and I probably could’ve been nicer. But I’ve been nice about it for 8 years and nothing has changed. AITA?

"AITA for not taking an 11 year old’s word for it? My(20) dad made some friends when he studied abroad. One of them is on a visit in our country right now, and he brought his daughter(11) with him. He asked if I could take her to our National Museum since it’s ’good for kids to practice some art appreciation.’ I said ‘Sure!’ She wasn’t very enthusiastic about it though.

When we were waiting for the opening time, she pointed at a nearby cafe and asked if I could buy her a cup of coffee, saying it’s the least I could do before making her spend two hours look at some boring stuff. I hesitated and she said her dad lets her drink latte so I called him just to check. He said yes before asking ‘Did you think my daughter is a liar?’

And I didn’t know what to say. It didn’t occur to me that that was what I was insinuating when I was expressing my doubt. I just wanted to be sure.

"AITA for telling a woman to keep her comments to herself in an elevator? This happened earlier today. I was waiting for the elevator in my office building. The doors opened, no one was directly in front of me, so I stepped in. A woman and an elderly couple were just behind me, but I hadn’t seen or heard them until after I got on.

As soon as I stepped in, the woman complained out loud that I didn’t let her on first. I was caught off guard, but I apologized and said there was plenty of room for everyone, so it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off; I genuinely didn’t notice anyone behind me.

She got on with the couple but kept going, saying how rude I was, how I had no manners, how people like me are what’s wrong these days, stuff like that. This went on for at least a minute, maybe more, and eventually I snapped a bit. I raised my voice and said Could you just keep your comments to yourself.

She went quiet, but the old couple sort of whispered something to her and gave me a look. Now I’m wondering if I just confirmed whatever idea they had about me, like maybe I actually was the jerk here.

I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to ride the elevator in peace.

"WIBTA if I threatened to turn of my Life360? I (19F) am in my first week of college. I've had life360 with my parents since I was about 16 for general safety reasons. However, they're a bit overbearing and controlling about where I go, even after I turned 18. I've found myself being extremely stressed about doing very normal things and being worried about them getting upset.

Before I left for college my mom asked me to leave my life360 on, joking about how she ""wants to know what ditch to get me out of"" if something goes wrong, which I completely understand, but my parents have been obsessively checking my location since I've gotten here. They've mentioned in passing places I went (literally like stores to buy stuff for school) when I didn't tell them I was going. They've been pressuring me to go to church and checking my location frequently to make sure I am (I don't want to but I like to keep the peace). It's a bit uncomfortable.

I'm wondering if I'd be an asshole if I told them that if they don't stop stalking me, I'm going to turn off my life360. I understand their reasoning behind wanting me to have it, but it's uncomfortable knowing that wherever I am they're probably looking constantly. 

I'd appreciate any input yall have.

"AITA for telling my sister that my nephew is NOT my baby?  My sister (23f) lives at home and has a 6 month old baby. She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent. She expects free childcare CONSTANTLY while she works and whatnot and gets very upset when I act hesitant about it for whatever reason. Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). 

And I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine. Especially when I’m on winter break for the next couple of weeks and just want to enjoy sleeping in way too late and being lazy before I’m thrown back into full time college (this has been happening for 4 months at this point though). So when she asked if I’d watch him tomorrow I got a bit of an attitude but ultimately said yes. But to that she got snappy with me and was like “Why do you always act like you don’t want to do it?!” To which I got upset and responded “Because he’s not my kid and I shouldn’t be expected to do this all the time.” 

She got VERY angry at me and is now not talking to me at all, and is surely going to weaponize my nephew against me. And to an extent, sure I understand her anger: I know that you should be able to rely on your village and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do this.

He moved in saying he just needed “a few months” until he was able to save enough money to rent his own place. It’s been a year, but he’s never once paid for bills, groceries, nothing. He doesn’t even do basic chores, but my wife (she's his brother) always tries to cover for him and does his chores for him instead. He leaves dishes in the sink, doesn’t take out the trash. Just sits around on his phone when he's at home to play mobile games or goes out on his motorcycle to go on long rides with his buddies. We’ve been biting our tongues because he’s family, but last week was the last straw. He came home late, parked his bike, and didn’t lock the gate.

"AITA if I gave my best friends kids a different lifechanging amount of money? I 37f recently received a lifechanging amount of money.  I haven’t told my best friend, 37f, yet that she &amp; her two kids (12f &amp; 2m) will each be gifted a lifechanging amount of money in an irrevocable trust.  Here is where it gets a bit sticky, I want to give 12f 2.5 million and 2m 1.5 million.  The reason I want to do this is because I helped raise 12f when she was little and I still have her with me every school vacation.  She genuinely fees like she is my child, she calls me mom, and there is no difference between her and my own children, it’s the exact same amount of love.  12f abused when she was younger which has resulted in several mental issues.  Her therapist has said it may be difficult for her to live a normal life and she will likely need lifelong therapy.  2m has his dad in his life (12f’s dad OD’d), his dad is a lifer in the military, and 2m is very blessed with new clothing, toys, etc (12f is not). 2m is setup better in life, it is what it is.  I grew up as the black sheep of the family and did not get the same opportunities my siblings did and has had a lifelong ramification.  I look at 12f’s life and I can’t help but see her childhood shaping up to be like mine and I don’t want that.  While I can’t change her situation, I can give her money to use to help her future.  Money is a tool after all. 

My concern is how my friend will take this.  In her eyes they are both her children, and they are treated equal.  I don’t want her to see the discrepancy in the amount and think I don’t love 2m as much or I see him as lesser than his sister, and I don’t.  But I am more invested in 12f and my motherly instinct is to provide and protect her.  In addition to this, this is a gift.  This is on my own free will and why can’t I do this?

"AITA for telling my sister I wont be her maid of honor because she didnt come to my wedding due to her dog dying? This is a throwaway as friends know my main.

So I (28F) got married last year. It was a small but beautiful ceremony with our closest family and friends. My older sister (32F) and I have always had a complicated relationship, we’re close, but she’s also extremely emotional and kind of dramatic. She was supposed to be my maid of honor.

Two days before my wedding, her 14 year old dog passed away unexpectedly. I was obviously sympathetic, but she called me sobbing, saying she couldn’t emotionally handle coming to the wedding because she was too devastated. I tried to talk her down, even offered to have someone bring her home early if it was too much, but she refused and didn’t show up.

It hurt. A lot. She missed one of the biggest days of my life, and I had no maid of honor. We didn’t talk much after that. A few months ago, she got engaged and just last week asked me to be her maid of honor.

I told her I couldn’t. I said I still felt hurt she missed my wedding, and while I love her, I just couldn’t pretend like everything was fine. She got extremely upset, said I was being cold and petty, and that her dog was like her child. Our parents are pressuring me to just be the bigger person.

"AITA For telling my Niece her mother tried to give her away as a baby? I (28 M) got into a huge argument with my sister (31 F) last week. The argument had been simmering for a long time, as tension between us has been high for years.

When I was 17 my sister had an accidental pregnancy, and when she told her boyfriend he left her. Due to our religious family she kept the baby, but once her daughter was born she panicked. She didn’t want to go through the legal troubles of adoption, so she asked that me and our mother took care of her kid. There was no legal custody, but it was an agreement made within the family.

I essentially raised my niece from birth until she was 3. With help from my mother, as she was working to support the new edition to the family. I dropped out of school and took care of her, fed her, changed her and taught her how to walk while my mom was away at work.

Then, my sister met her now husband, cleaned her life up and suddenly wanted her kid back. No warning, she moves back to home says thanks and starts being a mother. My niece is now eleven and doesn’t remember all I and her grandmother did. It’s been a family agreement to forget this all happened until the argument.

My sister made a petty comment during a fight, where she implied since I lost my job recently I can’t handle responsibility. I snapped and told her she was lucky her daughter was too young to remember how she abandoned her. My niece overheard this, and now wants to know what I meant. I outright said that her mother didn’t think she could raise her, and left her with me and grandma. Now my sister says I traumatised her daughter, and my mom says I should have kept the secret like we agreed. I think this secret couldn’t stay kept forever. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: hello, I’m here to give some more context and answer a bunch of the most common questions. When the argument happened, I had put my niece to bed hours ago. We were at my mothers house, and so no one knew she was going to come in.

Secondly, after my niece was born my sister moved states to get a job. Also, she was 20 and I was 17.

And finally, in the aftermath I said that we can’t go back now since my niece already overheard us all talking, so as a group with her stepfather we should get together to explain it better. But since the event (a week ago) my sister has been saying that we should blow over it and that my niece will forget if we don’t bring it up again. I’m frustrated at this, and at how she’s now slating me alongside my mother. My mother believes I’m in the wrong for arguing with my sister in the first place, whereas I say she has no right to criticise me for losing my job when I lost my education to caring for her child. I’m trying to get in contact with my nieces stepfather to ask him for his opinion. 

Edit 2: yes, I was asked by my mom to drop out of school and I did so. I didn’t go to college later. I had no intention of hurting my niece, but she had already overheard what was said so I felt that keeping it from her now would just cause her confusion. I’m now trying to backpedal the best I can with the families assistance, to be able to properly explain the situation to her. But, my sister and my mother both want to just pretend this never happened and hope my niece forgets as she grows up.

Edit 3: I’m starting to wish I was clearer from the beginning. I said I was 17 when my sister “had” the accidental pregnancy. I meant that I was 17 when the baby was born. ",Not the A-hole,1m1bx4k
"AITA for moving someone else's birthday cake out of reach of an entitled toddler? I was just at my girlfriend's mom's birthday party. We'd ordered an expensive cake for her and split the cost three ways with her sisters. 

Her brother, who *never* contributes to any of the shared presents, brought his spoiled 2 year old kid.  
While everyone was singing Happy Birthday, the kid started sticking his hands into the cake and licking them, and picking off the decorations.

I bit my tongue and didn't say anything either, *but.....* I reached over and moved the cake a few inches out of reach of the kid.   
  
Immediately the kid started thrashing around and screaming bloody murder. Everyone glared at me like I was the most evil POS on earth for doing what I did and rushed to placate the kid, *""awwh you poor little thing""*\-ing and giving him cake.   
I doubled down and calmly, rationally said what the kid was doing was incredibly unhygienic, it wasn't his birthday cake and he's old enough to be taught to wait literally one minute until he gets a slice of cake instead of destroying someone else's birthday cake and covering it with his germs.

"AITA for not bringing gifts to my nephews’ birthdays because they never give my kids anything? I (34F) have two kids. Over the past few years, my nephews have had several birthday parties. We’ve always been invited, and I used to bring gifts every time. But I started noticing that when it’s my kids’ birthdays, their parents never bring anything, or even acknowledge it. My kids don’t even get a “happy birthday” from them.

It’s started to feel very one-sided. Their parents (my brother and sister-in-law) are often cold and dismissive toward me and my kids. So this year, I decided I wasn’t going to keep doing something for people who clearly don’t return the effort. I still went to the party — but didn’t bring any gifts.

We have built a good routine for co parenting and things have been smooth for the last few years without any hostility. If ever a time in the past where she had to leave for work she would ask me to watch them full time in her absence which u always do, happily. A few weeks ago she found out she’s deploying for 6 months overseas and asked if while she was gone her husband could kept the same routine 50/50. I said no, that I had assumed I would have full responsibility of them. This upset them and it’s been a huge discussion ever since. She says I’m not thinking of the kids, their stability, their happiness. I argue that I disagree and that what parent wouldn’t want the opportunity to have them full again even if for a temporary time. I tried to explain that just because they are with me that I won’t cut their other lives out completely. They don’t want to hear it. The husband tries to make demands, every solution I’ve come up with doesn’t work for him and I clearly the bad guy to them. I want to add that our custody agreement even states I get them if she deploys and we live in California. So even though I don’t think I’m in the wrong here, AITA?

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They’re not everyone’s cup of tea, but I think they’re a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they’re “extremely gauche” and “lowering the property value of the neighborhood”. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn’t going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don’t live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor.

We remained friends as we've known eachother since childhood, regardless of that I still plan to stick to my work 8 years later.

I told him I was in the process of selling the house, he asked me if I had any offers and i told him yeah but from a few landlords. I didn't think that needed further explanation because he knows full well how I feel about landlords buying up starter homes in lower income areas, and how strongly I felt about turning this house into a home for myself and the next occupants.

He's absolutely furious at me for not going for a quick sale because he wants his measley 5k back _now_. I told him no way, and tried to remind him of all the offers we made on starter homes that just got swept up by landlords. It was devastating and we almost lost all hope of getting on the property ladder. None of them wanted this one because it needed so much work.

"AITA for telling my dad I can’t see how his prank was funny? I(16) live with my mom and visit my dad every Saturday. Last Saturday was different though. He asked to meet outside for lunch instead of having me over.

When I ordered iced latte, he snorted. I asked him what’s so funny and he said he ‘pulled a prank’ on my stepmom. Now Dad enjoys these things. He used to play videos of cats in heat to see our male cat’s reaction to the sound, along with videos of dogs barking. Switched off the light when I was in the toilet several times. Once he put a snake plush next to my mom when she was sleeping, knowing she is terrified of snakes. A lot of shouting that day.

So I asked him what he did. He said he made her latte but with whole milk instead of her usual oat milk, knowing she is vegan. Wanted to see if she would be able to tell. She got really upset at him, hence why he asked to meet outside.

Then Dad said to me ‘That’s funny, right?’ And I just pulled a face and said ‘Don’t think so, Dad.’ Because I couldn’t see how it’s funny. He looked annoyed and said that ‘people these days can’t take a joke.’ Told me that I’m his son and supposed to side with him, saying I shouldn’t be judgmental since it was ‘harmless.’",Not the A-hole,1oi51kf
"AITA for taking an Uber home instead of sitting on a man’s lap? So my best friend (Sarah, F22) recently got a new boyfriend (James, M23) and she is over the moon into him. Sarah is one of the very few people I hangout with. She recently just met James’ friend group, a group of guys, and they invited her to go on a beach trip with them. Sarah begged me to go with and kept insisting I join even when I declined the offer about 4 times. Eventually, I just agreed to go to get her off my back about being sad and alone. 

I was told that I would have a ride. Sarah and I were the last to be picked up, and when they pull up, there are four guys in a five passenger car. I see this as my way out. I say, “oh! Looks like there isn’t enough room for both of us. You can go enjoy the beach with your boyfriend, I don’t mind staying behind.” Sarah tells me that it isn’t a big deal if she has to sit on James’ lap to make it work. Immediately I feel on edge. 

Turns out, James was the one driving and said he wouldn’t trust anyone else to drive his car. He told me that I would be the one sitting on someone’s lap because there’s no way that he would let Sarah do that. I don’t know these guys at all. I pull Sarah aside and tell her that im uncomfortable, thinking that she would help me out. Instead she encourages me, saying that she thinks I would have fun and maybe even get a date. 

She is so into James and has been talking about this trip nonstop for over a week, so I decided to just do it to make her happy. 

Two of the three guys in the back (Sarah sits up front next to James) offer up their laps. I just pick the guy with the most leg room. We live about 45 minutes from the nearest beach so I thought it wouldn’t be too bad, except that I was told ON THE DRIVE that we were actually going to a beach an hour and a half away instead. My mood just becomes more and more sour. I never once relax, and eventually find myself quietly fuming once my emotions set in. 

The boys that I am squeezed into the back with just talk around me, physically leaning over me constantly, brushing up against me. Once we get to the beach, we set up and I finally find a moment to relax. I eat a sandwich I packed and read a book while sarah and James are lovey dovey and the guys mess around in the ocean. I was asked TWICE about why I only packed a sandwich for myself. Not jokingly either. Not once had I been asked to bring a single thing. 

When it came to the part where everyone was getting in the car, I just told James and Sarah that I had called an uber to pick me up because I didn’t want to sit on anyone’s lap for another hour and a half. Sarah tried to argue, but my ride showed up, so I left.

I got a call from Sarah a few hours later. She called me a bad friend for ditching everyone. When I told her how the whole day was making me feel shitty, she told me I was being selfish and that I had been acting like a bitch all day. I do not think I deserve that, but I am also pretty paranoid that I did something wrong. AITA ?",Not the A-hole,1j9dagd
"AITA for Refusing non-Veg at a Social Gathering? I’ve been a strict Jain vegetarian since birth—it’s not just a diet for me, it’s a deeply held belief. Recently, I visited a relative’s home where they don’t follow the same dietary restrictions, but they know about mine.

As dinner was being served, they casually offered me some mutton curry. I politely declined and reminded them that I’m vegetarian and would stick to cottage cheese curry and flat bread. I thought that would be the end of it. But no—just moments later, they again insisted I take some non-veg, as if my earlier response didn’t even matter.

At that point, I firmly told them that I found it disrespectful and that it actually hurt my sentiments. The room got a little awkward, but honestly, I felt like I had to say something. My friends who were invited as well told me that I was rude while refusing the food for the second time. They also mentioned I should have not called the host disrespectful during the conversation. 

However what triggered me was the fact that host smirked after offering me food for the first time. 

Now, I can’t stop wondering—was I being too sensitive, or was my reaction justified? AITAH?",Not the A-hole,1iq4399
"AITA for asking why I was left off a family photo collage? My in-laws are celebrating their 30th anniversary. My wife &amp; all her siblings decided to get a large framed photo collage for them as a present.

The collage, of course, has their wedding pictures &amp; and pictures of my wife &amp; her siblings as children. The collage also includes the most recent group photo of their whole family together at our wedding back in April. Additionally, the collage also has (seperate) pictures of her 3 married brothers with their wives &amp; children, &amp; a picture of her recently-engaged brother &amp; his fiancée.

However, there is no picture of me &amp; my wife, nor do I appear in any of the group pictures, not even in the family pic from our wedding.

I brought this to my wife's attention, &amp; her immediate &amp; annoyed sounding response was, ""It's not about you. It's about my parents and my family &amp; the grandkids.""

I said, ""I understand, &amp; I'm not saying it's about me, but I'm wondering, if there's pictures of your married brothers with their wives, shouldn't there also be one of us?"" Her response was, ""It's not about my married brothers &amp; their wives, it's to show off the grandkids!""

""Okay. What about the pic of [newly engaged brother] &amp; [fiancée]? There's no grandkids to show off there...""

At this point my wife gets upset. ""You know, you're really annoying me right now. My siblings &amp; I worked really hard to put this together, &amp; now you have to make it ALLLL about you &amp; the fact that you're not on it. Grow up. You'll be in other pictures in the future.""

Now truthfully, I don't really care that much about not being in the collage, but I am feeling very hurt and frustrated by my wife's response.

"AITA for not letting my husband attend his sister’s wedding? 
My husband (31M) and myself (28F) are expecting our first child this May, 2025. We found out very early in September, 2024. We did not keep this a secret from anyone and in fact, shared the news in person with his family and my family on the day we found out. During this period, his sister (29F) was getting to know someone and getting engaged in October 2024. It’s sort of an arranged marriage as she was set up and decided to get engaged only after 3 months of speaking to the guy. Her parents (my in-laws) were happy that she liked him and wanted to quickly move forward. She’s been wanting to get married for the past 5 years. 

After the engagement party in October, there was a brief discussion of when the wedding would be. His sister had mentioned that she wanted to be married by no later than April 2025. After our initial OB visit in September, my husband had mentioned to his parents that I would not be able to travel after 34 weeks as per the doctor. His mother decided to ignore this information and not address it. His sister and mother decided to plan on having the wedding in April 2025 even though they had not booked anything. His sister’s fiancé lives in Texas, a 3.5 hrs flight away. I briefly mentioned that I would not be able to attend in April as it would be too close to my due date but wished them all the best in their planning. 

February 2025 rolls around and they decided to have the wedding this upcoming April 19th of 2025 in Texas. I tell my husband that because I will be almost 37 weeks pregnant, that we would definitely not be able to go. A month prior, during a huge fight we had, his mom had told him it’s okay if I don’t go but that he would have to attend. At the time, I was not opposed to it, as I thought it would be fine.

Two weeks ago, we met with my OB, and I decide to ask her for advice while he was also in the room. I ask her for confirmation that it’s not a problem if he were to travel during my 37th week. She looks at both of us and says “Absolutely not” we both stare at her shocked and she continues and says “this would be like rolling a dice, I would not recommend it. If something were to happen, I would not be able to slow anything down.” He unenthusiastically agrees and says it’s messed up that they picked a date knowing we most likely would not be able to attend. 

It’s now almost April, and he just told his mother that we will both for sure not be able to attend. My husband and in-laws have a huge fight and he explains the situation so his dad threatens that he wouldn’t attend either if he’s not at the wedding. I don’t budge after he tells me this and calmly state that he simply cannot attend two weeks before my due date as we’re both having this baby together. 

So, AITA for not letting him attend his sister’s wedding? 


UPDATE: My in-laws have guilted him into rethinking his decision. I have an OB appointment two days before the wedding. He’s now planning on booking a ticket and deciding last minute if he’s going to attend the day before the wedding. He would fly out at 12pm on the day of, to make it in time for the main event and fly out the next morning at 7am. I honestly don’t know how to feel about this other than disappointment and fear of abandonment at such a vulnerable stage. My worry is that if it happens, he won’t make it in time because there are no flights between 6pm and 7am. To make myself feel better, I’m also trying to ration with myself about the likelihood of going into labour within less than 24hours at almost 37 weeks. Thank you all for your supportive messages, it feels good knowing that others see my perspective. 

UPDATE 2: Yes he went. I spent the time he was away with my mom and best friend (both decided to not attend the wedding) I did not move from the couch until he came back in fear of going into labour. His family called him on the phone nonstop until he got on a flight. I had booked him a 12:30pm flight so he arrived three hours before the event and he was on the 8am flight back the next day. My sisters were invited to the wedding and they told me that he refused to sit on his family’s table and that he did not speak to any of them all night long. He also refused to dance or be a part of the wedding. I sent his mother a very long text message explaining why I’ll never forgive her and that I will carry it with me forever.

He made it back and I did actually end up getting an emergency C-section a couple of days later. My baby is now here and he’s perfect in every way possible.

"AITA for calling out my sister in law for using her children to emotionally manipulate me into going to dinner “now” instead of waiting 45 minutes? This happened 2 weeks ago. I am 32 and my spouse is 29. My spouse and their family (parents, sister, her kids) were hanging out. I was doing some chalk art with the kids while my spouse caught up with everyone. We had a very light lunch and some snacks for everyone to graze while hanging out.

The time for dinner started to approach and my sister in law brought up heading down for dinner. I said that it was only 5:15 and we should wait until 6:00. She said she would like to go now. I said we should just wait and go at 6 because I had a coupon and there would be deals to make the meal much cheaper. The difference being from estimated $175 to under $75. We had already offered to pay for dinner before they arrived.

My sister in law grumbled about it and went to check on the kids and their chalk stuff. I didn’t think 45 minutes would be such a big deal. But a few minutes later the kids, who were fine a few minutes ago, came to the patio and were dramatically clutching their stomachs and saying “I’m soooooo hungry”

This annoyed me. I don’t like it when people use their kids to emotionally manipulate others. I think it’s pathetic. My MIL and FIL were easily swayed and said “Oh, well, let’s just get ready and head down anyway, it’ll be fine.”

I looked at my spouse and they said we could just wait, but their sister said no, and started to get the kids ready to go out. I was super annoyed at this and while the kids ran inside, I turned to her and said “Using your children to emotionally manipulate people into getting your way is pathetic.”

She said “everyone is hungry, just get over it, if you couldn’t afford to pay for dinner then you shouldn’t have offered.” I do get she has a point that we offered, but is asking for just 45 minutes seriously that big of a deal to have her try to use her kids like that? I would think most family would want to help each other save a little money. Am i wrong?

**Hi everyone I am editing this now since I think I got a lot of good responses.

"AITA for not wanting to educate a kid about my wheelchair. Hey everyone, 

I(39F) temporarily have to use a wheelchair for longer distances due to a currently undiagnosed issue with my leg. 
My PT advised me to use one, and my husband rented a nice, small wheelchair for me. 
I'm able to roll myself (good workout) and did some training and manoeuvres in our local shopping centre. 

I visited an small zoo last weekend, with my husband.
My husband was getting coffee and I was waiting outside the restaurant. 
A kid (age 7? Idk, not good with ages) and his dad, got curious about my wheelchair. 
I understand that kids get curious and want to ask questions, but I barely understand why I'm in a wheelchair currently. I was really not in the mood to explain my issues or be educational about it. 
So I just mentioned that sometimes someones leg doesn't work. 
Cue to more questions and I said that I didn't want to answer more questions because I was tired. 
The kids dad wasn't pleased with that respons and mentioned that it was a good lesson for the kid. 
Now, I basically wanted to tell him that I'm not a zoo attraction. 
But there was a kid, and I didn't want to make a drama. Luckily my husband showed up with coffee and rolled me away. 

Tldr 
Kid asks questions about my wheelchair. I didn't want to educate the kid about my wheelchair. His dad didn't like that.

"AITA for refusing to let my roommate's cat into my room after it 'apologized'? I (27F) share an apartment with my roommate, Lily (26F), who has a cat named Muffin. Muffin is adorable but has a habit of sneaking into my room and knocking things over. Last week, I came home to find Muffin had somehow gotten in and destroyed a puzzle I had spent hours working on. Pieces were scattered everywhere, some were chewed up, and one was lost entirely. I was furious.

I told Lily that Muffin needed to stay out of my room, and she agreed, but she also said Muffin felt bad and wanted to apologize. I laughed it off, assuming she was joking. The next day, I found a little note on my desk written in Lily’s handwriting that said, 'I’m sowwy – Muffin.' Along with it was a cat treat.

I thought it was funny but didn’t change my stance. Since then, Lily has been passive-aggressively saying things like, 'Muffin’s just trying to make things right,' or 'You’re holding a grudge against a cat.' She even suggested that I let Muffin into my room supervised so she can 'earn back my trust.'

"AITAH for keeping a ""Family"" cookbook that was previously thrown away More than 10 years ago my SIL's MIL passed away. The family cleaned out her house, took what they wanted, then decided to toss the rest. Before it was tossed, my SIL said to see if there was anything I wanted. All I could find was an old cookbook, which was in plain sight on the kitchen table. Fast forward to this year when I posted a photo of my island with cookbooks all over it (I was looking for a certain recipe). My BIL saw the photo and his mother's cookbook, then demanded it's return. I refused. The whole family is in an uproar. Half are on my side, half on his.

"AITAH for not completely changing my kids life just do accommodate her father? I (35f) was with my ex Tom (40m) for a few years before having our daughter 10f, when she was a few weeks old he moved out and in with some other girl and has rarely been involved. I finally put him on child support a few years ago and you’d think he was father of the year for paying $300 a month. He never really had custody, I NEVER kept her from him but I wasn’t going to chase him around trying to force him to be involved. 

Last year he remarried Peggy (45f) and is now asking for more custody. Obviously I talked to my daughter’s therapist and agreed to every other weekend for now, I’m not forcing my kid to change her life just because Tom now wants to play family. 

The problem is that Tom and Peggy’s house is just miserable for my daughter. I’m trying to keep her positive about it but honestly? They’re just not the kind of people or behaviors she’s used to. They yell a lot, don’t care about hygiene or keeping a clean house (nothing CPS would do anything about but does not meet normal standards much less mine), and she hates Peggy’s kids. There are five but two are older and on their own, but she has a son 17, daughter 12 and a son my daughter’s age and they’re basically feral. Just no supervision over there, always on their phones, so structure. Oh, and Peggy is an antivaxxer so there's that whole situation. My daughter plays soccer and they were 45 minutes late to the game last weekend and didn't think it was that big of a deal! She was texting me freaking out that she'd be late and when I called Tom he screamed at ME for calling.
 
Tom and Peggy also live out in the boonies, it's about a 25-30min drive from my house to theirs. I told him when he started coming around that I had no intention of driving hours or changing any aspects of our lives to accommodate him and he promised it wouldn't be a problem. Now here we are, and he's saying we need to set up a meeting point or switch off hand overs. I'm already pissed that my daughter needs to be in a car for so long just because Peggy ""needs to have a lot of property."" I told him no way, he was the one that chose to live so far from us, he can do the driving.
 
Finally, his most outrageous request has been to TAKE MY KID OUT OF HER SCHOOL. She got into our district's competitive magnet school, it's not easy and we both worked hard for it (me just filling out the forms and setting up meetings, she got in on her own merits). Tom says that his stepkids (that apparently he's adopting btw lol) are jealous of what my daughter gets to do at school and he wants to enroll her in their public school. NOT happening. 
 
My daughter has male role models, ones who actually care about her well-being and not just social media clout. Tom can say he'll go to court but I'll believe that when I see it, he has no gumption and honestly I doubt a judge would side with him anyways. I have always had full custody, have never kept her from him, but need to stick up for my kid... but does that make me the AH?

"AITA for telling my best friend if she wasn't always trying to get with my husband, her boyfriend wouldn't have left her? I (27f) have been best friends with ""Kira"" (27f) since we were little. We were neighbors, went to the same school, college, etc. She was my MoH when I married ""Rowan"" (28m), who we went to college with. At first, Kira had a big crush on him, but he started liking me. We slowly got closer and I started liking him too (this was after Kira had told me she'd gotten over it and was dating another guy). But I still felt really guilty and didn't want to date him if it would hurt Kira. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it and she said she was, so I thought it was fine.

Kira's been with her latest boyfriend, ""Adam"" (27m), for a year or so. However, over the last few months, she's been acting strange around Rowan. Whenever we'd be hanging out with the three of us, or even with Adam there, she'd always find some way to sit next to Rowan, laugh at everything he said, etc. I didn't think anything of it initially because I knew that's kind of her personality, and her and Rowan are friends. But then she started always asking me if Rowan was there before she came over and if I said no, she'd often suddenly say she couldn't come, though sometimes she would say that even if I said he was here. Rowan also told me about a comment she made to him once about how he was so patient for putting up with me being ""too tired to do anything with him"" now that I was pregnant, which I thought was weird.

The odd behavior continued but tbh the pregnancy had been keeping me too exhausted to give it a lot more thought, and Rowan seemed as friendly with Kira as always. But two days ago, our mutual friend ""Shay"" threw a dinner party. Me and Rowan went, as did Kira and Adam. Kira got a bit tipsy, and she kept trying to sit with Rowan and touch him. He excused himself a few times but she kept finding him. I tried to get her off a few times, and I was getting mad because this was a new line she was crossing. She was slurring about how I ""stole Rowan from her"". Thankfully Adam was too busy talking to Shay's husband to hear this, but he definitely saw Kira's actions.

The next afternoon, I was at Shay's again with some friends when Kira showed up. She was crying about how Adam had broken up with her that day, saying he didn't think they were going to work out. Everyone was consoling her, but I was just kind of sitting there. I couldn't help but feel like she brought this upon herself. She asked me ""Aren't you going to say something?"" so I said ""Maybe Adam wouldn't have left you if you weren't trying to get with Rowan all the time"". Some of our other friends were shocked to hear this and got mad at Kira. Some got angry with me, saying Kira was just really friendly with everyone and that was a horrible accusation to make.

Kira was upset, saying she couldn't believe I thought that of her and maybe we really weren't that close. She left in tears and I left soon after too. Now I don't know, maybe I was wrong? Kira had been drinking at the dinner party and might not have meant what she said, and the other stuff could've been nothing. Maybe this was too harsh to say to her after a breakup and we could've talked privately, not in front of our friends. AITA?",Not the A-hole,1hvle7f
"WIBTA if I refused to give up a water fountain the previous homeowners abandoned 4 years ago? In September 2021, we purchased a home that was built in 2019 &amp; we moved in immediately. The previous owners (PO) left a few things at the home, including a water fountain.  Within the first month, the PO asked if they could collect the fountain, we said that was fine, but they never came. It’s now March/April of 2025, 4 years later, and has been sitting in the front yard.  Over the last 2 years I have been organizing, prepping, and designing my front garden where it will be incorporated into my design. 
I am an avid gardener and decided to redo the garden, but haven’t yet planted any thing. It’s has taken me a while to actually get started for multiple reasons. The first year we were settling in. 2nd year I had to learn about the seasons (I’m from FL, we don’t have seasons) research native plants, best planting times, amongst other things.  The most important reason was because the house was built poorly and we had to repair an entire wall that was in the main section of the garden. There is no point for me to plant when we will be doing construction work. After we finished the exterior part of the wall, winter started. 

The roof still needs repairs, but I have access to the area now. I planned on power washing, repairing, and painting the water fountain this weekend, but I got covid and again delayed. I dismantled the fountain and relocated it to various places to be worked on. 

Suddenly, the PO messaged my husband stating he wants the water fountain back, it’s his 45th anniversary soon and it was his wife’s 35th anniversary present. Stating he’ll be by this weekend to get it. I told my husband to inform the PO that I’m no longer willing to part with it. PO, states it’s not mine to ‘part with’ and he’ll be by to pick it up.  It has been on our property for 4 years. It’s considered abandoned property after 30 days, we gave him the chance to pick it up, but they didn’t. We’re not a storage unit. What claim is it his to come get it? I understand it was an anniversary gift but clearly he didn’t care enough to get it in the last 4 years. 

This house was brand new, but terribly built by the PO.  Everything that could be wrong is wrong. Roof is missing edge pieces, subfloor is uneven causing the entire floor to be uneven with gaps in all the wood, the ENTIRE house needs new siding because they installed the Hardy Board incorrectly and now falling off, 4 different colors &amp; textures of caulk used in the backsplash of kitchen, screws popping out of every single wall in the house, studs aren’t 16” on center. The list goes on and on. We literally have to rebuild the house from bottom up. Before you ask, yes we had an inspector but no he didn’t catch these things.  We’re also trapped in the house because we bought during the VID times and the interest rates were very low.  So, moving isn’t an option. Trust me, we would if we could. 

So, AITA for not giving up the water fountain 4 years after he sold us a terribly built home?

"AITA for leaving my SIL’s house after she invited me over to ""not be alone"" but just wanted free childcare? I (25F) had to put my cat down unexpectedly, and it has completely shattered me. He wasn’t “just a pet” — he was my best friend, my emotional support, my companion through everything. I’ve had him since I was a teenager, and I loved him more than I can explain. Making the decision to let him go was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I held him in my arms at the vet while he passed, and I genuinely don’t know how I made it home after. I cried all night. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t eat. I took the next day off work because I couldn’t even function — I was in absolute pieces.

That day, my sister-in-law called and said she didn’t want me to be alone, and invited me to come over. I was hesitant but also grateful that someone seemed to care. I thought I’d be able to just sit quietly, cry a little, maybe talk about him if I needed to — basically just *exist* around someone so I wasn’t drowning by myself.

But the moment I got there, it was clear that “not being alone” actually meant helping her with her kids. We immediately left to pick them up from school. Her son didn’t want to get off the jungle gym, and when I just stood there, SIL got annoyed that I wasn’t physically removing him — even though I could barely stand upright without crying.

Back at her place, she told her son I would help him with homework while she made dinner. I tried to gently bring up my cat once or twice — I honestly just needed to talk about him — and each time she cut me off with “you’re just having a moment” or said we didn’t need to dwell. I felt completely dismissed.

Then her son needed help in the bathroom and she asked *me* to do it. I don’t know if she realized, but I’d been crying on and off the entire time I was there. I hadn’t been able to think straight since yesterday. I wasn’t even sure why I agreed to come. And now I was being asked to play babysitter, while grieving the most traumatic loss I’ve ever experienced?

At that point, I just stood up and left. I didn’t say much — I didn’t trust myself not to sob or scream. I just got in my car and went home.

Later she texted me saying I upset her kids by “storming out” and that she was trying to *help me take my mind off things*. But I don’t think she ever actually saw how much pain I was in. ",Not the A-hole,1kydarz
"AITA for sending Child Maintenance statements to my ex-MIL I (35f) split up with my ex just over a year ago. We had some issues with getting him to provide for our son (now 8). His parents were very much interested in the drama. When I made an application through official ""Child Maintenance Service"" and he received a schedule listing his monthly payments. His parents contacted me asking to agree to an unofficial payment plan, because the CMS amount was just too much, claiming that getting a lower amount agreed between us was better than not receiving a single penny through CMS. I refused, deciding that having this agreement on paper and not receiving it would still be better than *maybe* getting something.

My ex didn't make a single payment and *lost his job* shortly after. His child maintenance amount was recalculated granting him payments of £7-ish/week, which he still refused to pay, which then caused the CMS to collect the money themselves and charging him (and me) some extra fees for the service. His parents were very much aware of it, and complained about it, especially about the fees \[he gets charged 20%\] and about the arrears that are still on the account.

I'm sorry for the long intro, but I find it important.

To the issue- it was my son's birthday last week. I took time off and took him on a 2 short stay at one of the UK's theme parks. When his dad and his family found out I received a call from his mother complaining that now that I live off her poor son I can afford taking my kid to trips like this and making his dad look bad in comparison. \[for context- we've been to multiple theme parks over the years, including last year, when my ex still refused to pay a penny for his son\]. I couldn't help but laugh \[in hindsight, I appreciate that it was immature, I just couldn't collect my self quickly enough\] and told her not to contact me about this ""issue"" again.

Well, she messaged me shortly after. I received a wall of text basically telling me off for making her son struggle, when I spent his money on memories and making myself look like the better parent.

I couldn't take the bs and took two screenshots:

1. holiday booking confirmation (including hotel, park tickets etc)
2. Total Child Maintenance payments received in the last year

I sent it to her with a note: ""Has your poor son sponsored our trip or has he taken active part in providing for \[son's name\] over the last year? You can't claim both. Pick one, please.""

In response I received more angry messages from both ex-MIL upset about being called out like that, and from my ex, who was angry that I got his mother involved and that I pointed out how bad he is at providing for our son.

I don't think I got her involved, but my opinion may be skewed, so here I am, asking: Reddit- AITA?



EDIT: I thought I'd edit the post to answer the most repeated question:

I've been in touch with my ex in-laws solely to allow them to stay in touch with my son. They have a good relationship with him, but they struggle to make arrangements with my ex to have proper grandparent- grandchild time during my ex's custody times. It's worked quite well in the last months.   
  
I do agree with you guys- this incident just made me want to ~~seize~~ cease all contact with my exMIL and I will contact them letting them know that from now on I'd like them to make alternative visitation arrangements between themselves, so I can have some peace and quiet. Your comments about being TA to myself made me realise that in attempts to keep my child happy and have contact with his extended family I've given them too much freedom to try to butt in and comment on my own life.",Not the A-hole,1mbgu22
"AITA for walking out of the restaurant and leaving my friend My girlfriends and I went a restaurant two days ago (I was the designated driver). I ordered my meal and they ordered their meal. I went to take a picture of my plate and before I could even take the picture, one of them used her fork and stirred up my food. I got upset and asked her why she would do that and she told me it was “cringe” to take pictures of food. I could tell the other girls were uncomfortable but no one stood up for me. All I wanted was a damn pic because my plate was presented beautifully. I got upset and just walked out the restaurant and drove home, leaving them behind. When I got home, I asked who paid for my meal and Zelled her the cost. They started texting me and telling me that it was just a joke, what I did was immature and that it was wrong of me to leave them behind considering I was the driver. I do feel like I overreacted but I also feel like what she did was mean. AITA?

Edit: 
- I did tell my friends I was going to leave, “I don’t wanna be here anymore” then left. 

- My meal was steak, gravy, mash, and caviar, and it had a hibiscus plant on it since people are assuming it was pasta. Not sure if that’s important information or not. 

- The girls who didn’t stand up for me, laughed at the situation awkwardly. I could tell they were uncomfortable but they didn’t say a word. 

- The person who paid for my meal was one of the girls who laughed, not the person who stirred up my plate. 

- I was only trying to take a picture of my plate, I wasn’t holding anyone back from eating their food.",Not the A-hole,1oz7d1g
"WIBTAH if I only spoke German to my husband despite him requesting I don’t? I f(31) recently signed up to sit an advanced German exam with the full support and encouragement of my M(30) husband. We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no.
WIBTAH if I carry on auf Deutsch? 

UPDATE: Thanks to most of you for very well-thought out and reasonable comments. I tried to read as many as possible and appreciate the different viewpoints. My husband came home this evening, we ate dinner, and I apologised (in English) for not being very understanding. I showed him the post... some of the comments made us laugh so much. We discussed and found a healthy compromise that works for both of us to help me prep but not exhaust him after a long day! I've also taken on your suggestions of other places I can try and hone my German conversation skills and will try some of them out. ",Not the A-hole,1ii6hjp
"AITA for making my children pay for their own portion of our family vacation? We have been planning on going on vacation to cuba for the Christmas holidays for a week. It’s pretty pricey during the Christmas holidays but that’s the only time we can all go. We have three children 20F, 15M, and 12F who we are making them pay for their own ticket and part of the hotel since we wouldn’t be financially stable enough to pay for 5 plane tickets and such. 

My 12 year old daughter has been complaining that since the other two have jobs and she doesn’t that it’s not fair. However we’ve decided to stick firm with it and be equal to them all. Their other option if they don’t want to pay is staying at grandmas. She has savings which are just enough to cover the vacation but she also wants to save up for a phone. My other two children aren’t happy that they have to pay for their own but they are willing to since we’d be going to cuba. 

AITA for making them pay? I feel like most families don’t make their children pay for their own tickets but since we all really want to go my wife and I think it’s the best option.

Edit: my 12 year old daughter (almost 13)  is going to grade eight and she has worked at our business a couple times for me which i would pay her.",Asshole,cu9zri
"AITA for being concerned about the damage my son did to my car? I am a mother of two; Vanessa (25) and Brandon (22). I am not married to their father, but they both have a relationship with him. They went to visit him this past weekend for Father’s day and were set to get to my house on Monday. 

Brandon drove the two of them there and was supposed to drive back. The car he drives was mine originally. I paid it off and did not ask him to buy it from me on the condition that he is responsible with it; he was only paying for gas and maintenance. This was the first car I have ever been able to pay for upfront without taking out a loan, which carries sentimental value, so it is my car as far as I’m concerned.

 A few minutes after they left their dad’s, I got a call from Vanessa saying that they had gotten into an accident. I asked if the car was damaged, and she told me it was totaled. I was immediately furious because Brandon knew how hard I worked for that car and I was very clear that I expected him to care for it. I asked Vanessa to please put her brother on the phone. Instead, their father came on and explained that they were in the emergency room and that our son was receiving treatment.

My ex then started to berate me for being more concerned about the property than about the kids and for getting angry at our son without knowing the situation, but in my defense, I hadn’t realized that he was injured. To be clear, Brandon will be fine and the other driver was completely unharmed, but they are all still furious with me. I had assumed that if his injuries were serious that it would have been the first thing they told me, but that isn’t a good enough explanation for them. Its been a few days now and both kids are still with their father and won't come stay with me. AITA?

UPDATE: First of all, to be very clear, I do not care about the car more than I care about my children. It was a moment of heightened emotion and I spoke before thinking. I can concede that it was insensitive. To be clear again, my son has a concussion and a few broken ribs but will be fine. The car is unsalvageable, and yes, it is insured, but that will not replace the sentimental value, but it's fine. Now, I called my children to apologize and explain that I would not have asked about the car first had I known that they were in an ER. Vanessa admitted that she should have told me that first but that she was very stressed at the time. I was not able to get far into the conversation when their father came in with some choice words for me, and the call ended shortly after. I believe he may be manipulating the kids into not wanting to talk to me or come over, but they are adults and that is their prerogative. My plan is to let it play out. ",Asshole,1lgcirt
"AITA for wearing a different colored bridesmaid dress after the bride tried to purposely make us look unflattering? Hi, for privacy reasons this post will be a throwaway, and all names are fake.

Recently, I (28F) was a bridesmaid in my friend Tara (28F) and Tony's (30M) wedding, along with bridesmaids Amy (27F), Jane (29F) and her sister Lily (32F).

Tara was one of those brides where everything had to be perfect, so early on, Tara placed her priority on the logistics. Because of this, Tara had left the details about the bridesmaid dresses for last. 

Tara had organized a lunch for us in April to talk over the details of the dresses. She handed out swatches and said that the dresses must be in that color and floor length. I asked Tara if she was being serious to which Tara asked what the problem was. Simply put, the color was ugly and unflattering. Jane also spoke up and said that this color is going to make everyone in the party look bad. Amy also agreed. Tara rolled her eyes at us and said that she was sure and she expected us as bridesmaids to go along with what she wanted. Lily decided to chime and say that she thought the color was fine. I think that she said this to prevent her younger sister from going full bridezilla.

For months, Amy, Jane and I BEGGED Tara to consider a different color, but she wouldn't budge. We asked Lily to ask her sister to reconsider, but she said that she was the bride, and that we should ""respect her choices."" Yeah, no shit she was the bride, but that doesn't mean that we have to sacrifice the way we look, and look unattractive. Amy pointed out that Tara was probably making us look bad on purpose, so that she could look better, and that made me furious. 

And here's where I may be in the wrong. Amy, Jane and I decided that enough was enough and that Tara was being really unreasonable about this whole thing, and so was Lily. So we decided to lie to Tara and say that we were going to order dresses in the color she wanted and sent her screenshots of dresses in that color. Meanwhile, the three of us created a separate group chat and decided to order dresses that would actually make us look good. We agreed on baby blue and bought the dresses online. Tara didn't ask any more questions about the dresses and essentially just took our word that everything was okay.

Flash forward to wedding day. The moment we put on our dresses, Tara lost her shit. She started yelling at us and crying, and Lily had to escort her out of the room. Apparently she must have gotten ready elsewhere, because we didn't see her up until we were called to go to the venue for the ceremony. The wedding was great, but Tara was upset.

Since the wedding, none of us have heard from Tara. However, Lily and Tony have been texting me, calling us horrible people and claiming we ruined the wedding. Tony even said that Tara almost cancelled the whole thing, and he had to force her to go through with it. Maybe Tara was upset that we didn't get the color that she asked for, but I don't think it was right for her to make us look unattractive. AITA?",Asshole,16ew3md
"AITA for being upset that my husband attended the wake of his friend’s father, even though the friend has repeatedly disrespected me? Context:
My husband’s childhood friend (CHF) is also someone I knew from high school. We were once friendly, but over the years, he’s shown himself to be a bully  especially toward the women in our friend group. He hides behind “jokes” to make hurtful comments, like calling wives and girlfriends by their partners’ exes’ names, making jabs about infertility, and mocking them for where they are in the relationship (ex. yet to be married)

He’s done this to me twice.

• The first time was on Christmas Eve, when he repeatedly called me by my husband’s ex’s name even after being corrected.
• The second time, after being called out by my husband and others, he showed up at another gathering. Instead of apologizing, he hugged my husband and then again called me by the ex’s name right to my face.

After that, my husband cut contact with him. We haven’t seen or spoken to him in months.

Now:
CHF’s father recently passed away. My husband told me he feels strongly about attending the wake to pay respects to the family, including CHF’s mother and CHF himself. I’ve told him how uncomfortable this makes me. I’m hurt. I know our mutual friends will use this as a chance to “mend” the friendship, and it feels like my pain is being sidelined.

This to me feels like a betrayal. That CHF’s feelings and family take precedence over mine. It’s shaken me. I feel “unsafe” in my marriage and in our social circle. 

My husband insists this is about honoring the deceased and that it’s separate from the issues between me and CHF. He says it’s about his values and doing what’s right.

But I can’t help feeling devastated.
Am I being extreme for saying this has made me question our marriage?
Am I the asshole for being so upset and throwing a fit?

Edit: Leaving the post up, but I’ve come to accept that I am the asshole in this situation. I’m genuinely thankful to those who responded and helped frame the context in a way that gave me clarity. I’ve received the insight I needed, and I kindly ask that further comments refrain from piling on.

Edit2: For clarity over my husband’s relationship with the husband if it matters: No friendship or interaction between the two of them. My husband has positive interactions with the wife, the mother of CHF.

Edit 3: He ended up staying on a few hours, and there was reconciliation involved. My takeaway too is that there is expectation that all of us will be back to normal. To quote a few things “does the punishment fit the crime” (in connection to my stance towards CHF) “what happens next time when there’s a get together with my friends, I cant go?”
The friend apparently apologized to him, and asked to extend an apology to me.
Anyway, this whole thing just left me feeling confused now.",Asshole,1ov3jqm
"AITA for always going home for the holidays? I (36M) love my family and, unfortunately, live on the opposite coast from them. My girlfriend (34F) is local to where we live. We've been together 7 years, no kids or plans for kids.

I always travel out to see my family 2 times a year - Christmas and 4th of July. I work at a college, so I essentially have a school schedule for breaks. 

My family is so important to me. I take the whole 2 weeks I have at Christmas to stay at the family house. Christmas is special for us, we go all out. I have a large family, it's a whole event that I really look forward to. We have traditions, big family dinners, the works. 

(I get around 4 weeks off for summer and spend 1 week of it with family too.)

My girlfriend has a small family and doesn't really have holiday traditions. The family she does have is not very close, and fairly dysfunctional (her words). I've invited her to my family's house for the holidays, and offered to pay the ticket when it's expensive. She's been out maybe for 3 Christmases and some summers. 

When she doesn't come along, she stays home by herself. I buy her lots of gifts so she can open them while I'm gone. 

I thought this was a good thing. I can see my family, she can have the option of seeing my family and go along for the trip too. 

But recently she made a comment about not having any of our own traditions because I'm ""always gone for the holidays"". That hurt my feelings, because she's always invited where I am. 

Her dad passed away in '23 and she didn't come to family Christmas that year. She said she was too sad to celebrate. Then in 24' she had a mild health issue that made travel not super comfortable. So she hasn't been to family Christmas in a little bit. She is going this year. 

Am I the asshole for always going to visit my family for the holidays? 

We've chatted about this some, and she says she's glad I can spend time with my family, but does feel like she gets left alone. My thought is she's not alone if she wants to come with me. ",Asshole,1p6md8t
"WIBTA if I stayed at my parent's place while my wife stayed at the hotel My wife and I are going to be attending her friend's wedding which is in the same city that I'm from, as in my parents still live there. It's on a Saturday with some events on Sunday and our plan is to fly out with our 1 year old on Friday and spend 2 nights there.

My wife and my parents, particularly my mom don't get along too well. I'm fortunate that we're far enough that they have to meet infrequently and when we do meet they do remain cordial but distant. My mom could've been more tactful, my wife could've been a bit more understanding too, its just issues that can not be bridged and I won't try to. However, I thought we could stay at my parent's house while we're there.

However, my wife is adamantly opposed to the idea and says she needs us to stay at a hotel. I brought up the fact that we meet them on important family occasions without issue, that this was a good opportunity to spend some quality time but she said this was different, it was her friend's wedding, she wanted to be in the correct headspace and not be stressed. I brought up that staying at my parent's would mean more help with getting the clothes ready, and our son. But she's just flat out saying no. She says we can meet them for lunch or something when we land and before leaving but we can't stay there.

I didn't push the issue further but the more I think about it the more unreasonable it seems to me. Us not staying is 100% going to open a whole new can of worms in an already fraught dynamic.

"AITA for hiding my boyfriend’s dead dad’s heirlooms? Am I the asshole for hiding my boyfriend’s dead dad’s bird heirlooms in the house we share together? I (27 f) and my boyfriend (32 m) recently moved in together after dating for eight months. I know that seems early but given rent and our schedules, it just made sense. He owns the house, which he inherited from his father who passed away last years.

The house has all of this dad’s old furniture, art and Knick knacks, and while they’re not horrible in quality, they’re not really my style. The plaid wall paper is a bit overwhelming but my real issue is that there are shocking number of ducks (bird sculptures, a coat rack with birds carved in them, bird paintings, etc). Honestly, it’s a lot of birds and I really want to make this our home, but it feels like I’m living in his dead dad’s bird mind palace. 

We’ve spoken about getting new furniture and redecorating the house, but every time I so much as mention the birds, he completely shuts down. I understand he might have sentimental value here, but he has never told me about his dad’s bird obsession before, and i really am struggling to understand why these birds are so important. I mean, I’m willing to keep a few select birds for sentimentalities sake, but the sheer number of birds currently is just ridiculous.

Last week, I removed one of the less conspicuous birds and hid it in the basement to see if he would notice or care. He didn’t say anything, so the next day I took another. I have now hidden seven birds and yesterday he finally confronted me about it. I came clean but said that if it took him so long to notice, then why does it matter so much that we keep them all? He started yelling about how heartless I am and  how I am debasing his dad’s memory. So I could understand better, I asked him straight up, what is so special about the birds? And he said, if you can’t get that now, you never will. We haven’t spoken since last night. I don’t want the birds to get in the way of our relationship but I really don’t want them in my home. I think I’m the asshole for hiding the birds instead of talking to him about it. I also think maybe I forgot something about his dad which makes me an even bigger asshole?

"AITA for asking my brother to bring me along? My (F18) brother (M27) and his wife (27) are going to NYC which is about 6 hours away from where we live. Their plan is to drive there and spend a few nights then drive back. On a related note, one of my oldest friends in the world moved to NYC 5/6 years ago. I’ve been planning on going and visiting her anyway, but my dad doesn’t want me to drive since it’s pretty far.

So I asked my brother if I can come with them, and he could just drop me off at my friend’s house on their way. He looked at me funny and went “…I’m not doing that” and I asked why and he said he wasn’t going to bring me along on a vacation with his wife. I said I wouldn’t be coming on the actual vacation he could just drop me off and he said that they’re going to be in the city for multiple nights and he doesn’t feel right leaving me alone in the city for that long. He asked what my plan was for sleeping and I said I’d just stay with my friend or worst case scenario sleep on the couch in their hotel room but he literally laughed in my face after that.

He said he definitely wasn’t letting me into their hotel room on their vacation and that he didn’t want to babysit me during the trip. That was pretty mean of him since I’m literally not even going to be with them most of the time, and I said that it wouldn’t be babysitting since all he’d have to do is drop me off and pick me up. He said “and drive you there, and drive you back, and let you sleep in our hotel room” but my thoughts are that driving, sleeping in the hotel, those are all things that he’s doing anyway and it wouldn’t cost him anything extra to let me come along. The actual vacation they’d still be alone it would basically be like we were just driving near each other.

I said all this to him but he just kept saying no and that he wouldn’t do it, and I guess I might be the Ahole because I told him he was being stingy and prioritizing his wife (who he only married like a month ago) over his actual family who’s known him as long as he’s been alive. I know he hates being called out like that but I was just really angry. After that the conversation basically ended and he started ignoring me.

My wife was never someone to really dress up or put to much thought into her looks. She’s always been beautiful but never did much to highlight it. Until recently.

She went through this crisis of feeling like her she didn’t have a personality outside of being a mom. Something like that. So for the last 2 years, she’s started traveling more. Joining different groups. Dressing really nicely, wearing makeup. 

I never realized how much of a difference it would make but people treat her completely different. She is constantly getting complimented, told she should be in magazines. She’ll come home and happily tell me about the random stranger who was so nice to her. She randomly gets gifts, lady at her job brought her an an book series she was interested in. She gets hit on.

"AITA for getting one of my coworkers fired? I 20M am a server at this restaurant and my former coworker, Sophia 18F was also a server who has gone off to college. For context, I would always make these dumb but funny jokes about babysitting Sophia considering I’m older than she is and I’ve been working there longer than her and she is barely an adult but I still made those jokes about her when she was still 17. Honestly though, Sophia is still pretty much a baby. 

But anyways around Sophia’s last few days working here I made a joke which left her embarrassed. I was making a salad and then she came over to make one as well and she made a joke saying that it smelled like eggs and she asked if it was me. I told her that it was probably because her body smells like a fish.

She didn’t say much and later I continued to say “can anyone smell something fishy” in front of the other coworkers and everyone laughed but Sophia moved her hair in my face and I said that she had lice and everyone once again laughed. Sophia was very upset and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the shift and I tried talking to her but she wouldn’t even look at me. At one point one of the prep cooks asked me why I treated her like that and even said that I traumatized her. The problem is that Sophia got bullied when she was in high school for these exact reasons and I only brought back all her trauma by what I said. I didn’t know though. 

Towards the end of our shifts, I was closing and I thought it’d be funny to mess with Sophia by asking her if I have to babysit her again.

Once we were let out she ran to her car in tears and drove home. The next day she filed a complaint to HR and even told another manager and I got talked to. Throughout the shift she wouldn’t speak to me. I asked if she can hand something to me, she wouldn’t do it.

"AITA for pointing out my sister's blue hand? I (27M) have an older sister (34F). She is a professional chef, and she has a lot of culinary-themed tattoos. Recently she got her hands tattooed with measurements she uses a lot in the kitchen, like teaspoon and tablespoon and that sort of thing. She says she actually refers to them at work a lot, but I really think she just got them because it makes people ask her what they're about and then she gets to talk about being a chef. It impresses people and I know she enjoys the attention.

  
Recently, we were having dinner with our parents and some family friends. The conversation turned to tattoos, and of course my sister started talking about her new ones. Since they're food-related, that steered the conversation away from tattoos and onto cooking and recipes. I kept waiting for the conversation to go back to tattoos so that I could talk about my newest one, but it wasn't happening. Finally, I found an opportunity to point out the fact that one of my sister's tattoos is such poor quality it dyed a part of the skin around it blue. That happens if the artist presses too hard and it's permanent, which means it was a cheap tattoo.

  
Everyone else looked really awkward, but my sister laughed for some reason and said something like ""yeah, I just have a blue hand now, oh well"", and that really bothered me. I have many tattoos myself, but all of mine are really meaningful and I take a lot of care to find good artists. She obviously doesn't take them seriously and just gets them on a whim, but since hers are mostly for attention, everyone wants to talk about hers instead.

  
I told her she shouldn't be so casual about having a bad tattoo and that it looks like it was cheap. I told her I'm glad she likes it but it looks like she's been taking colloidal silver or something. My dad told me to let it go and my mom kept trying to change the subject, and finally my sister just said ""my tattoos are personal, it's okay if you don't like them"" and ignored me for the rest of the night. My mom thinks I should apologize and apparently the friends who were there thought I was out of line. Personally, I think I was just pointing out a fact, and I honestly want her to get better tattoos in the future for her own sake. AITA?",Asshole,18d9wlz
"AITA for having my 18 year old daughter pay for her own feminine hygiene products? My 18 year old daughter graduated a week ago, she pays rent, splits the bills with me, and pays for her own phone bill. She’s a very independent young girl. 

As a 56 year old woman, I’m at an age where I don’t have a menstrual cycle anymore and so I don’t buy products for that purpose anymore, and so it turned out to happen when she turned 18 so it was as if it were perfect timing to stop buying them, but even if she were under 18 and I didn’t have this anymore I would stop buying them as well. Since she’s 18 I feel better about not having to go out and buy them since she’s at that age where she’s graduated and independent. 

My boyfriend somehow found out that she’s been using napkins she bought at the grocery store, he said that he asked her why she bought 2 packs of napkins and she explained that she needs them for personal use and assumed it was for that. I didn’t believe him at first until I asked her about it and she explained to me that she makes homemade “tampons” by rolling the napkins, and she does it to save money. I have money myself so I could go out and buy them for her but she would need to pay me back. 

He asked me what I thought when I finished talking to her alone and I said that he was right and explained that she does it to save money, and he was furious and said that I should be providing those for her. I told him that I no longer buy them because I no longer use them, because when I did I would share but now, especially because she’s 18 she can buy her own. I know she’s my daughter but the support has to stop sometime. The reason my boyfriend was furious was because she got her thing and found out there were no products left so she had to use napkins and now she only uses those. This is her own issue to deal with, and she has no problem being self-sufficient. She’s been 18 for several months.",Asshole,nuqs3r
"AITA for rehoming my cat? Hello everyone.

So when I was 9, my parents rescued a 5 year old cat from our local animal shelter. I agreed to getting the cat, since I was 9 at the time, and of course I wasn't going to turn down the opportunity to get a fluffy animal. However, I'd be lying if I said I loved the cat growing up. I didn't hate the cat by any means, but I came to realise that I'm definitely more of a dog person. However, we never owned any animals apart from the cat, since my dad has a fear of dogs for some reason.

Last year, I moved in with my boyfriend, and I took the cat with me, since my parents thought that the cat had bonded to me more. I was fine with this, since the cat does it's own thing. However, problems began to arose when me and my boyfriend got a French Bulldog puppy, since neither of us had been able to get a dog up until now. The Frenchie was very gentle towards our cat, and doesn't bother her. The cat, on the other hand, made her distain for him VERY apparent. This was done through hissing, loudly shrieking etc. This went on for a year, with the cat's behaviour towards our dog gradually getting worse. I live 2 hours away from my parents, so taking the cat back to them wasn't really a viable option. After making all the efforts I could to get my cat to get along with my dog, albeit, to no avail. I decided to take my cat to the local animal shelter, since cat's tend to be easily adoptable when compared to dogs. 

My parents recently came to visit. While they were here, they asked me where the cat was, to which I told them that I'd taken it to the local animal shelter. A huge argument ensued, despite the fact that I'd reassured them that the cat had been adopted, since it was no longer on the shelter's website. My parents left shortly after, and we haven't spoken since. My boyfriend has sided with me on this, saying that had we taken our Frenchie to the shelter, there's a good chance it may have been euthanized due to the over abundance of dogs in shelters.

"AITA for siding with my kid against my wife? My (44M) wife (42F) and I have three kids. Let's call them Josh (15M), Megan (14F), and Sharon (12F).

Wife has always enforced strict rules. The relevant rule here is her rule around chores. She has a list of chores for the kids to complete weekly before Saturday morning:

1. Make your bed
2. Do your laundry
3. Do the dishes
4. Take out the trash
5. Vaccuum the living room
6. Clean their rooms
7. Clean their shared bathroom

Each week, wife will assign communal chores to each kid, and each one is responsible for their individual chores like cleaning their own room. These chores are assigned ahead of the week, and if they're not done by Saturday morning, they can kiss their weekend plans goodbye. They're not grounded, but wife revokes their privileges to hang out with friends until the chores are done.

Josh has entered his rebellious phase and he's really been pushing limits recently. This weekend, he had plans to go snowboarding with his friends. He assured his mom and me that his chores would be done this morning. Come today (Saturday), the dishes haven't been touched, his laundry remains in the hamper, and you can't walk through his room. He was fully decked out in his snow gear and when wife asked him what he thought he was doing, he grinned and proudly announced he came up with a plan. He made an agreement with his sisters that if they did his chores today, he would do all of the communal chores the following week.

I thought this showed good problem solving; wife felt differently. She said that was not the agreement. He started to bargain and negotiate with wife, growing increasingly desperate and frustrated. Trying to be a mediator, I asked wife if it really was necessary to revoke his ski trip. He found a way to make it work so the chores get done, and we teach our kids to keep our commitments, and he made a commitment to his friends to go snowboarding with them.

My son couldn't have looked happier in that moment, wife was floored. She said he came up with this plan without running it by her. It might be a different story if he brought this solution to her last night, but he's just trying to do an N-run around us. She said he could not go, end of story.

This is where I might be the asshole: Unable to control his anger, he yelled ""F you!"" to wife. You could hear a pin drop in that moment. I was so caught off guard by this outburst, I started laughing and couldn't stop. Wife looked at me with betrayal. Then, she quietly grabbed her purse and walked out of the house. I know I shouldn't have lost my composure, but I honestly am not sure if I'm the a-hole for siding with my son. Wife's rules seemed a little unreasonable given the weight of the outcome.

TL;DR: I sided with my son in an argument he was having with my wife about chores and he told her ""fuck you"" and I accidentally laughed.",Asshole,1bargv7
"AITA for not offering to help pay my friend’s $1,500 vet bill after her dog ate my medication? A few weeks ago while at my friend's (let's call her ""M""), I accidentally left my medication out, and M's dog ate it. She had to take her dog to the hospital and ended up spending about $1,500 on treatment. I feel awful about it, but I’m currently unemployed and don’t have any money. Because of this, I didn’t offer to help pay the vet bills, thinking she could handle it since she has savings.

Today, she brought it up when I mentioned wanting to finance a PS5 (just $42/month since I can't pay outright). She said it wasn’t fair that I was thinking about buying something for myself when I hadn’t offered to help with the bills. I told her I didn’t offer because I literally don’t have the money and that if she had asked me directly, I would’ve tried to pay over time. Now M's upset and feels like I’m dismissing her, but I was so scared for her dog I literally threw up so I don't understand how I'm being dismissive.

AITA for not offering to pay when I’m broke? And is it wrong of me to want to buy things for myself when I still feel guilty about what happened?

**UPDATE 10/12 10:20pm CT:** This was actually written from the dog owner's perspective, ""M"". I covered the full medical expenses and didn't ask my friend to pay because she told me earlier that day she was struggling to pay for food, and she's a close friend so I didn't want to add to her burdens even though I'm struggling as well. I paid for our food and wine that night. Then, when she told me she was thinking of buying a PS5 and I questioned why she would make a luxury expense when she didn't offer to help pay Maya's medical bill, she attempted to villainize and emotionally manipulate me.  I sent her this post and said ""thought it might help to see how others are seeing this situation"" and she (or her sibling) is now commenting on this post going off, so I've posted our full conversation here since I was actually giving her the benefit of the doubt in the initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g281l9/comment/lro0hys/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g281l9/comment/lro0hys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) (&amp; a screenshot of our conversation with dates): [https://imgur.com/a/KjJmTaX](https://imgur.com/a/KjJmTaX)

Also screenshot of my receipts to prove this isn't bait: [https://imgur.com/a/CjJWXdK](https://imgur.com/a/CjJWXdK)

**Some key points:**

* This happened just about 2 weeks ago. I didn't ask her to help pay because she told me she was struggling to pay for her food, and I didn't want to add to her burdens since I do have emergency funds set aside, and our friendship was valuable to me. I make 42k and I make constant sacrifices to build my savings, even though most months I'm at a deficit. She is very aware that I struggle with funds.
* She commented that she DID offer to pay over time, but as noted in the comment exchange, she did not. She was with me when the hospital told me what the expenses were, and she remained silent, even though I kept bringing up how I don't know how I'm going to afford it.
* She says that I ""often have money and a lot of nice things"" which makes me feel like noting she is 30, lives with her parents and doesn't pay rent, and had a job that paid nearly double what I make for years before getting laid off and she is choosing to remain unemployed after the layoff. If I have savings and she doesn't, there's a good reason for that.
   * Additional note: She spends thousands of dollars on kpop albums, concert tickets, travel  expenses for kpop shows, and has admitted to have a spending addiction. I had no issue with these things as they didn't affect me, until she played the victim today for not having savings.
* My comment responses from her perspective used words she explicitly said to me - I didn't fictionalize any of it.
* When Maya was hospitalized, I couldn't stop crying and couldn't sleep. I kept checking my phone throughout the night thinking I was going to get a call that she had died. For days afterwards, I couldn't take my eyes off her in case she had side effects or permanent brain damage. I'm still too scared to leave her alone for more than an hour or two because I'm terrified something will happen to her.",Asshole,1g281l9
"AITA for wanting my boyfriend’s kid to work or go to school? My boyfriend’s son is 18, he’ll be 19 in May and graduated from HS last spring.  He didn’t get a semi- FT job until the middle of July.  He was working very minimally at a restaurant. I didn’t make a big deal about it, because I figured he was taking a “break” after HS.  So, he got the semi-FT job at this landscaping company in the middle of July.  Everything was going well until fall.  He decided not to go to technical school or college.  Well, school isn’t for everyone.  The problem I have is that since the end of October, he hasn’t been working hardly at all.  We live in the Midwest, so there is no lawn mowing or landscaping after October.  So, right now he is working even less hours at the restaurant and maybe shovels snow once every so often.

"AITA for reporting a delivery driver who I thought was lying to get out of doing more work? Throwaway account because I don’t want this linked to my main.

So today for lunch I decided to order from a Mexican restaurant through one of those food delivery services. I’ve had a bad experience or two where my order was missing some items, but the drivers would always be gone before I realized and could catch them to fix the issue. I’d always have to report it through the app’s support chat, which is such a pain to use because they obviously outsource their representatives and it’s frustrating trying to communicate with them. I usually give up after a few messages back and forth.

When my driver arrived, I told her to stay so that I could check the bag and make sure everything was there. I noticed she kind of raised her eyebrow for a moment but otherwise she stood quietly and waited. Sure enough, a couple things were missing. I politely said she needed to return to the restaurant and get my missing items.

In a very neutral, rehearsed-sounding tone, she said that it’s “against company policy to do that and I should contact support through the app.” I explained that I preferred not to deal with support. She said they’re the only ones who can help and she’s *really* not supposed to go back to the restaurant. 

I was a bit annoyed at this point so I asked what the company policy was on making sure orders were correct. She said that restaurants close the bags for the drivers and they’re not meant to open them or the containers inside. Something about food safety violations and not being trained (?). After a moment she apologized for the trouble and left. 

To me this honestly just sounds like a bunch of BS excuses to get out of doing her whole job. If they “can’t go back to the restaurant,” how are customers supposed to get their food/money back? If they “can’t open bags to check the orders” how do they even know they’re delivering the right food? It makes no sense to me.

So on the page where I rate my driver and can leave feedback, I made a note of my situation and explained why I thought she was in the wrong. I then left one star and revoked my tip.
A bit later I was talking to my sister over the phone, who I thought would enjoy the story because she works for a different-but-similar delivery company. My sister said “did you ACTUALLY think she was gonna go back to the restaurant?” I laughed, thinking she was taking a dig at a competing company’s drivers, but she just said “I’m not joking, you literally reported her for following the rules.”

At first I thought my sister had misunderstood a part of the story or something so I kind of brushed it off, but now based on her reaction and what both her and the driver said, I’m wondering if they’re right?

"AITA for telling my dad and stepmom I don't agree how they're raising my son? I was really wild in high school and got caught up in stuff. I tried getting everything together and even went to UCLA until I got a girl pregnant there. Basically my dad and stepmom adopted our son after he was born before they moved to San Diego. I moved elsewhere and time flew.

My son Brian is now 8 and I regret not being there but now I do. I found out about how they're raising him and I don't agree. For example, my dad is pretty controlling. He doesn't even post pictures of him on Facebook. They signed him up for the scouts which is pretty outdated. The other thing I don't like is that they are always spending time together when my kid should be spending time with other kids. The worst thing is that he's in this exclusive religious school. That's funny because my dad pulled me out of my local high school to go to a religious school and the kids were way worse just rich. They also won't let him be a kid. When I was a kid, my room was messy and was allowed to do what I wanted. My son can't even eat there.

I'm not a kid anymore. I have worldly experience. I have a say and it's of value. So I told them both and they got furious at me. I asked who is being childish now? I'm offering a dissenting opinion and they can't handle it.

I don't like being sidelined and having my opinions ignored when I have something to offer. The reality is that I care.

  
Edit: I don't owe my dad anything. He should actually THANK me for creating that kid. My son is his golden child and basically my son's existence is my dad's life. 

Also I was 21 when that girl got pregnant. I was pretty much a kid myself.

"AITA for dropping my daughter from my wife and I’s medical insurance? My daughter is 23 and just got a call from her gynecologist. 

She apparently had previously had an abnormal Pap smear that she never informed us about. However, then she got a biopsy which came back abnormal and she probably needs LEEPs. 

I am very disappointed because I know she got HPV from a boyfriend I disapproved of because he was obviously someone who didn’t look like he’d be loyal. And now she’s stuck with the consequences and my wife and I feel like if we pay for her treatment it would be condoning it. We feel that she has no right to be sobbing and hyperventilating while also going on the “ it’s not my fault mantra” and we don’t want to enable her further.

Now we are making steps towards ensuring that we will never have to pay for anything she needs medically, and for that matter materially anymore. Her credit cards have been cut off but the dropping from insurance process hasn’t progressed that far. 

What makes us even angrier is the fact that she had just lost her entry level job due to her company closing down and she chooses to continue to see unreliable boyfriends. We raised her better- I built a great family business from nothing and I shudder at what people would think if they knew my daughter got an STD from sleeping around at such a young age.

"AITA for calling out my daughter for hypocritical behavior? I (39M) have a daughter who is 20 years old. Her mother and I were never married and we split up about 6.

When my daughter was growing up I had to travel a lot for work and when I was home I usually worked long hours. As a result I wasn't as involved in her life as most parents and our relationship has always been strained because of this

The traveling and long work weeks ended about 6 years ago when I got a new job. Shortly after that, I met my current wife and we have 2 children together, who are 5 and 2.

My daughter has never been very fond of my wife and while our relationship has always been rocky, after I got married it started to feel like she resented me. She's never been particularly interested in spending time together and once my wife came into the picture it got even more difficult to get my daughter to agree to do things together, even things as simple as having lunch/dinner together. 

Whenever we did manage to arrange something she always asked if my wife was going to be there and eventually asked me to stop inviting her, which I did.

Even when it's just the 2 of us though, when we meet or talk even over the phone it always comes back to her complaining about her childhood and claiming that I was never around. Which is false, as I did reach out and was as involved as I could be, and I've tried to explain the reason to but didn't make a difference to her

My daughter has never met either of my younger kids. Everytime I see or talk to her I ask if she wants to come over and meet then and she dismisses me or changes the subject every time. A few months ago, for one of my kids’ birthday, she came to my house with a gift bag and just handed it to my wife without saying a word before leaving.

A few days ago I called my daughter and we ended up getting into an argument over this. I told her that my younger kids have a sibling that they've never met and that it wasn't fair to them but she still wouldn't listen to anything I said. Eventually I told her that I don't want to hear her complain about me not being around much when she was younger, since she was doing the same thing to her siblings, and she told me it was different because she wasn't their mother.

I told her that family was family and that she should still at least make an effort, and all she said was no before hanging up.

My wife obviously agrees with me but pretty much everyone else in our lives (friends, family members, etc) have been telling me that I was out of line and that the way I treat my daughter is wrong

I don't think I was wrong to say it and I can't recall any instance where I've treated my daughter poorly, so I'm really just interested in what mutual people have to say. AITA?

"AITA for only taking my wife &amp; sons to Disneyland? I'm 40 years old and live with my wife (34) and our two sons (7 and 5). I also have a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship. My daughter's mom and I were never in a relationship when she got pregnant with my daughter. My daughter has always lived with her mom, she visits us 1-2 times a month on the weekends. 

For years ever since my wife and I got together we always do 2 trips a year for each of our birthdays. When our kids were born, we skipped the trips for a few years and then as they got older we left them with her parents for our little 4 day trips. Now that the boys are older, we took them to the Grand Canyon for my wife's birthday a few months ago. We were surprised at how good the boys are at traveling (quiet on airplanes, they don't mind walking for a few hours, just generally in a very good mood) so we thought we'd do something bigger for my birthday - a trip to Disneyland. This is especially special because I haven't been there either (I grew up poor and Disneyland was just too expensive). We flew out last week (before the Thanksgiving rush) and enjoyed 5 days in SoCal/Disney. It was a fun, fun experience. 

When we got back, my daughter (who has already been to Disneyland with her mom) visited and found out about the trip from my sons. I wasn't hiding the trip from her at all I just didn't think it was a big deal because she's already been there before. My daughter was very upset and said it was unfair that she wasn't invited or included on the trip. 

I told her that it was a family trip for us and that her mom wouldn't have covered her half of the ticket anyways. Her mom is not in poverty or anything, she's just a teacher without much cash to spare. I legitimately tried to reason with my daughter. If her half of the ticket was covered, she could've joined us. I've never had my daughter yell at me much less as much as she did that day. I don't understand the issue when 1 - she's already been to Disney 2 - her mom couldn't have afforded that extra expense 3 - my sons weren't jealous of her when she went a few years ago. I just don't get the issue. I told her that we enjoyed the trip so much that we're going back in March when the weather is warmer and that we'll let her mom know now so she can start saving for the ticket.

"AITA for telling friends that my girlfriend (f33) writes fanfiction? My girlfriend, Sandra (f33) and I (m35) have been together for about a year now. We’re not living together (yet) but we’ve talked about this. We’re both working in respectable fields. 

The other day, I was out with some mates and after our night, I was slightly tipsy and I thought of surprising Sandra (of course, a fake name) as I have keys to her flat.
When I got there, I noticed she was asleep on the couch and her laptop was on the coffee table. She hates sleep mode so she disabled it so her laptop was on, not even locked. She had a word document and it seemed she’s been working on it.

I caught some words and couldn’t help myself, I started reading. I took the laptop to the kitchen to not wake her up. Turns out it was romantic fan fiction about one of her favourite tv series. Nothing steamy, just some silly, girly, romantic notions kind of bs. You know the ones teenage girls dream of and then realise no man actually behaves like that. It’s like “no Susan, I ain’t touching the small of your back because you’re cute, not catching those harassment allegations” if you know what I mean.

I was curious and desired to spy a little bit to see if she’d written more and discovered her accounts on 2 platforms for fan fiction (had no idea those sites were that huge). Anyway, she’s written a lot of them. All cutesy, girly shit and some naughty stuff (again, unrealistic in my opinion).

When she woke up in the morning, I confronted her about this and she was defensive and started going on about privacy and stuff. I told her to cut the crap and to admit that she feels dissatisfied about our relationship and that’s why she’s writing and I gave her a reality check and said her “soft” men she writes were unrealistic. She was really angry and kicked me out. I told her I’m not one of her characters and won’t tolerate her mood swings but she still kicked me out.

Later that day we were meeting our friends for lunch. Sandra came but barely spoke to me. At some point, we were talking about something and I mentioned what Sandra writes, hoping that people will laugh and one guy did, the rest just ignored my news which kind of surprised me, I tried to continue the topic and understand why everyone’s seemed okay with the cringe but Sandra called me an asshole and went to the bathroom. My friend told me it would be best if I left but I didn’t want to do so because  didn’t do anything bad.
When Sandra came back she told me her writing is her private thing and I’m an asshole for bringing it up. 
I told her to grow up and call me when she comes to her senses but she’s hasn’t called me since.

"AITA for wanting my son to give part of his inheritance to his younger half-brother? My husband, Matt (52M) and I (46F) have three children; a son Andrew, 24, and two daughters, ages 12 and 8. When Andrew was growing up, I felt a bit trapped in the role of a stay-at-home mom. Matt was (and still is) a great father and earned more than enough to afford all the necessities and some luxuries too (we had just purchased a new Infiniti which Matt had picked out) but I wasn't happy and was seriously considering asking for a divorce.

One day I was involved in a minor fender bender while out shopping. I was driving our still fairly-new car and Andrew was with me. None of us were hurt but neither of the doors on the passenger's side of the car could be opened. Andrew was understandably upset, (and so was Matt). The guy who hit me, Raul, was actually very nice. We exchanged contact info, and honestly I really enjoyed talking to him. So I began seeing him whenever Matt and Andrew weren't home. Honestly I was happier than I had been in a long time, but I eventually felt guilty. I told Raul that I wanted to work on my marriage. So we broke up.

I confessed everything to Matt, and he agreed to go to counseling. Around this time, I found out I was pregnant with a baby boy. We did a prenatal DNA test and it showed that Matt was not the father. I decided to give my son up for adoption after he was born, so that's what we did. Matt and I then had our two daughters. I've always felt guilty about the adoption, so a few years ago I did a DNA test and found my son, Diego. I was horrified to learn that grew up in foster care and had an unhappy childhood. He always wanted to know his biological parents. He found Raul and has a good relationship with him. I told Diego that I wish things had been different.

Matt's parents, who passed away in 2021 and 2022, left half of their estate to Andrew, and the other half was to be divided between our two daughters. TBH I thought this was unfair, but it's the way they wanted to do it. The girls will receive their portion of the estate when they turn 18. I have yet to begin distributing the money to Andrew, and the reason why is that I feel strongly that half of his portion should go to Diego.

I have told Andrew that I would like give half of his portion to Diego because it’s the least we can do to make up for the fact that I should never have given him up. He’s my son, and the only reason why I gave him up is because I thought it’s what I needed to do to save my marriage, but he’s had a really hard life as a result. Matt has taken Andrew’s side saying that not only is this this unfair, but it’s against what his parents wrote in their wills. I know that there’s the legal aspect, but there’s also the moral aspect of me wanting to make up for a mistake I made when I was in a bad place. Matt is now threatening divorce, while Andrew has saying some really horrible things about both me and Diego to pretty much anyone who will listen.

Additionally, my daughter believes that I've been treating my stepdaughter better than her(I don't believe I have) which has led to a significant amount of resentment.

We've had multiple arguments about these issues, and it has reached a point where our household was constantly tense. We recently got into another heated argument due to my daughter cursing her stepmother out calling her the ""b"" word and in a moment of frustration, I suggested to my daughter that if she couldn't find a way to coexist peacefully with my wife and her stepsister, it might be best for her to move in with her mother.

As a result, my daughter has gone to live with her mother, and both of us are dealing with a lot of emotional pain and distance between us. I never intended to kick her out, and I miss her terribly, but I thought it might be the best solution to prevent further conflicts in our new family dynamic.

"AITA for being closer to my sons than my daughters? I (38 M) have been married to my wife (34 F) for 7 years. We have 4 kids together, aged 7,6,4,and 4. 6yo and 4yo are boys, 7yo and 4yo are girls. Me and my wife got into a pretty big argument recently and I need unbiased opinions. 

I feel like I've always been closer to my sons rather than my daughters. You know I'm a boy, I like boy stuff, so do they. I don't like princesses or dolls. So I've always gravitated towards my sons because we have more in common. 

Anyways the argument started after my wife had put the kids to bed one night. I was laying down and she came into the room and confronted me about what my 7yo daughter had just told her. According to my wife, as she was tucking my daughter into bed she started crying and asked, “ Why doesn't daddy like me”. My wife told me that the kids notice how I treat them differently and I needed to stop acting like I hated my daughters. I told her I don't hate them, but we don't have anything in common. She was pissed and started yelling at me about how immature I was being immature. I think it's stupid. Obviously dads are going to be closer to their sons, that's just how the brain works. I tried explaining this to her and she just didn't listen. She left and I think she went to sleep in my daughter's bed. I'm not sure.

So am I the asshole? I just want my wife to understand what I'm saying and she's not listening to me.",Asshole,1hzeaem
"AITA for posting an “ugly” photo of my friend on her birthday? 
My (23F)) friend (Syra, 23F)) is visiting our hometown and coincidentally, her birthday happened to fall during her trip. We had a lot of fun on her birthday, but I fear it ended on a somewhat bad note and I’m not sure if it’s my fault. 

So for context, Syra lost about 40 pounds two years ago. She is very athletic and pretty now, but she was kind of the person who looked pretty no matter what body she’s in. She can pull anything off, in my opinion. 

Anyway, there’s this picture of us back from 2021. We are both at her vacation home, hugging. I think it’s the most adorable picture ever. It’s almost like a bear hug. I am completely enveloped by her and we look really cute. 

Before I posted it, she got a glimpse of my collage. She asked me not to post that particular photo of her. I asked her why, and she said she feels really insecure of how she looks in that picture. I told her she looks great and I showed her my wallpaper on her chat (which is set to that particular photo). She replied it’s one thing to have it as my personal chat wallpaper and another to publicly post it since there are a million photos of us since then (post weight loss). 

I posted the picture anyway since it’s my favourite picture of us. It led to an argument and now she’s claiming I posted it not because I think she looked pretty, but because I look pretty and skinnier in comparison in that particular picture. Which is not true at all.

"AITA if i refuse to give my bf $70 for my senior dog peeing on his controller? Hello! I’m just going straight to the point.

My mom is offering me $300 due to the fact I am basically homeless and have no clothes to wear since they had to all be thrown out. The current clothes I wear are disgusting and dirty or I have to wear my boyfriend’s clothes. I have been wearing the same clothes for months without anything clean.

My senior dog (around 16 years old or older) had peed on his PS5 controller and broke it apparently, At the time i was dealing with trying to keep myself mentally together and distracted since i've been struggling for a while what feels like on my own with barely any support at this point. Now he is asking me for $70 out of $300 that is supposed to be used for me to get decent clothes or at least something clean to wear. I don’t know if I am being selfish by not wanting to give him any money due to the fact that I mostly have been cleaning his room on my own, taking care of 3 pets on my own, and taking care of him. I barely have time to take care of myself so I look like a complete mess. I want to add as well, I recently had found out I have a unknown kind of tumor in my chest and multiple masses in my chest wall along with other issues, yet still taking care of everything despite how painful my chest gets. The most he does is cook me dinner. The rest consists of him being in his room all day playing games. He has never helped me clean let alone gets angry when i ask him for help with anything. I have no where else to go due to the fact I cannot get a job because I cannot even afford an ID yet. I just started life and it’s already beating me while i’m down.

I just need to know desperately AITA for not wanting to pay for his gaming controller? He is demanding money from me once i get my hands on it.

"AITA for calling my wife selfish for leaving our son with a sitter? 
I’m away from home a lot of the time due to work commitments, which is tough because I don’t have as much time as I would like to spend with my family, and although I try to talk with them as much as possible when I’m away, communication is limited. Recently I found out that my wife has been hiring a sitter occasionally for our son [7] when I’m away, so that she can go out to dinner with friends. It came as a  surprise to me because we usually plan these things together when I’m at home. 

I appreciate the efforts she puts into taking care of our son while I’m gone, but I work long hours during my trips, and learning about the sitter arrangement left me feeling pretty annoyed with her. I asked her why she had never told me before and she said that it just never came up because we only talk in short spurts, and she didn’t think it would be an issue because we usually get a sitter for a night when I come home. 

I told her that it isn’t right and she’s wasting money selfishly, because she gets breaks during the day and after our son goes to bed, and it’s wrong to leave him when I have to work 24/7 on business trips. I told her I didn’t want her to do it again but she got upset because she didn’t think it was fair.",Asshole,18yhocr
"AITA for not wanting to hear about my coworker's deceased aunt? I, (30's male), was interrupted at work first thing in the morning by my, (40's female I'll refer to as 'Alice'), coworker telling about her aunt's passing. 

As I'm sitting at my pc working this morning, Alice barges in and states she had a bad weekend due to her aunt's passing. She then goes on to tell me in detail how they moved her from the ICU to hospice, and that she got to be there as she passed. For context, she dies this not even an hour after I start work AND It's Monday morning after the weekend. Discussing this type of topic makes me very uncomfortable, but I didn't want to stop her because it seemed rude, so I let her tell me the 30 min. story. After her story and some tears, she goes back to her office. By the end of the whole thing, my mental state was a mess due to some past trauma surrounding this topic.

I complained to a friend about how inconsiderate it is to barge into someone's office and take up their time with a traumatic event, but I was told I was being rude and should have shutdown the conversation and set boundaries if showing empathy was too much, (making me feel worse). In an attempt to come up with a solution, I choose to tell Alice a few hours later, that I'm sorry about her aunt's passing but that not only did she take a lot of my time, but she also trauma dumped on me and made my day a little worse. I then added that in the future, her business is her business and I don't want / need to know about it. I said this in the kindest way possible. She then responded by saying she would, ""Just never tell me anything again."" At which point I said that was fine. She did eventually apologize saying she wasn't trying to be hateful, she just needed time to collect herself. 

She keeps trying to be a close friend when I send clear signals I just want to be coworkers and nothing more. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to be involved in her personal life / be her friend?  Also, for setting a boundary because about her personal affairs due to her trauma dumping about her Aunt???

"AITA for telling my dad his dating life is over? I 21F live with my dad (60s) and little brother 17. My mom passed away about 10years ago and my dad was in a very devastating condition. He loved her so much, being a single dad was very very hard for him but he always tried his best. After 2years since my mom’s death, my granny and aunt (on my mom’s side) suggested my dad to get married… it felt too soon but they kept pushing it. My dad felt that there needed to be a mother figure in the house especially for my little bro. So he went and married a lady my aunt and grandma brought in our lives (technically it was an arranged marriage). 

Apparently the lady agreed to marry my dad cause he worked in a very successful airline company so marrying him would give her the free flight privileges and other stuff. Fast forward almost 6months after they married, our home became hell… they were always arguing. Eventually they divorced and he blamed my granma and aunt for being responsible for the whole thing. 

Now almost 7years after all that, he asked me what i would think if he gets married again. I told him that its ridiculous and the only purpose he wants it is to have someone to take care of him while he is old which is selfish to the other person and how now he doesn’t have anyone to blame if things go bad. I also said that he has nothing to offer the new wife (who is non existent). Maybe its the ptsd of the last failed marriage trauma, because he married her too for the same reason;stability.

"AITA for making my son apologize to my nephew for having a tantrum and making a scene  Me (42F) and my husband (47M) have a son (14M), I'll call him Lucas. 

Lucas is generally a sweet and nice kid, he's friendly, he's very open, etc. He likes to read comics and draw, I think he's pretty good at it. I'm really proud of him, I couldn't wish for a better son. 
Anyway, Lucas has been visiting my sister (28F) for 3 days. My sister has a son (8M) Gabriel. I was hoping Lucas would be friends with him. I exchanged messages with Lucas and he always said it's going okay. 

Yesterday, I went to my sister's house to pick up Lucas and she looked really hurt. Lucas was sitting there glum as well. I asked what was wrong and my sister told me to ask my son that question. 
It took me a long time to convince Lucas to tell me the truth, and he finally admitted what was wrong. 

As I understand it, Gabriel was curious about what Lucas was drawing (he had his sketchbooks with him). Lucas let him see his sketchbooks, but told him that Gabriel should handle them carefully. 

But when Lucas was outside, Gabriel (with his mother's permission, as I understand it, and I'm not excusing her for this) decided to check Lucas's things. When Lucas returned to the house, he found his sketchbooks torn up. I mean, I'm not excusing what Gabriel did. 

But according to my sister, my son didn't want to call me or my husband and he didn't want to hear Gabriel's excuses. He threw a tantrum and called Gabriel a ton of names, even though my sister said he was just a kid. All these days the atmosphere in the house was tense, my sister didn't call me because she was offended.  

My sister said she didn't even know if she would still want me or my son at their house after that. 
I said Lucas should apologize to Gabriel and his mom. Lucas was offended, but did so. 

When we go to home, I asked why Lucas didn't tell me that Gabriel had torn up his sketchbooks. Lucas cried and said, ""Because you never care."" Those words hurt me deeply and were a low blow because I really love my son and I didn't think he could say those words to his own mom. But I promised him that I would buy him new sketchbooks and he could redraw his drawings in them. 

But my husband thinks I acted like an asshole in this situation and Gabriel and my sister are wrong. 

**EDIT** Okay, I realized I was being an ahole because I didn't even ask if Gabriel apologized to my son. Today I bought Lucas new scetchbooks and apologized. Lucas no longer looked offended. For those wondering: I was hoping the boys would become friends because Lucas has always been good with kids and Gabriel has no friends.  ",Asshole,1dlbijt
"WIBTA if I said my co-worker’s brother’s death “wasn’t a tragedy” due to how preventable it was? Last week has been quite a disaster for my co-worker (30F). You can call her Aly, Ali, Allie, etc. but anyway I remember her being confident and content the day we went into work. Her brother Rhett (26M) would end up falling off a roof of his house hours later. From what I’ve heard, he was conscious at the time of the hit and believed he was okay and that he felt fine so he didn’t call emergency services. Turns out he was really messed up internally and died and when I found out Ally’s brother died, I was in shock and saddened by her loss. I couldn’t imagine losing a sibling. However when I heard more information, I couldn’t help but think he was reckless. What was he doing on the roof? Why didn’t he just call for emergency services just in case? If that was me, I would have definitely have done that, especially knowing something like this could put my family throw grief and sorrow if it ended fatally. It was unfortunate that they had to lose him, but when I think of tragedy, he’s just not what I think of. Careless and reckless deaths don’t belong in the same context of “tragedy” as other types of deaths. Now, I would never ever say this to Aly but I’ve considered venting this to other friends or co-workers but I just don’t know if they would see my point or not. Many of the co-workers especially seem like the type who would disagree with my stance but it only makes me feel it stronger in a sense. A reason why this would come off as asshole-type behavior is that Rhett was a minimum wage worker from lower-class income and he may have just decided to let it go because he was afraid of being in steep medical debt if he went to the hospital. I do see the point of how class would have an effect on his death but I don’t know if that was really his reasoning. I don’t know him well and I’m not a minimum wage worker. Would just simply venting to someone I knew who knew Aly or Rhett (other than Aly) be out of line or is it okay?",Asshole,uxvg8m
"AITA for 'stealing' from my 17 year old stepdaughter? I 46 M have been married to my wife Amanda 41 F for 6 years. When Amanda and I met She had two children from a previous relationship Chloe 17F and Marcus 15 M. Despite their father being absent, the children have never viewed me as a parental figure which does not bother me as although I love their mother, I don't see them as my children or feel any love for them. They're good kids, just not mine.

Earlier this year Chloe expressed her desire to move out at the end of the year. I did not think she could realistically afford to move out. Her mother and I both work long hours, so Chloe leaving would mean I would most likely have to hire help or cut down my working hours as she does a lot to help out at home so her leaving would not be ideal. I handle all household expenses so In order to deter her from leaving I suggested she try paying a portion of the bills/home expenses to get an idea of what living alone will be like. Her and her mother both agreed this would be a wonderful idea and so we drew up an agreement that she would pay ¼  of the bills and household expenses and her mother and I would stop financially supporting her.

I thought this would be enough for her to change her mind however she was able to afford this comfortably. I decided to lie to her and tell her that due to inflation our bills and expenses had risen greatly and she would owe me an extra $150 a month. My hope was that even if she could still afford to pay me she would not be able to simultaneously save enough money to move out.

Recently her brother Marcus was doing a school project that required him to analyse our families electricity, gas, water etc usage. I foolishly allowed him access to my study to look over our past bills. At some stage he asked his sister to assist him in his work. When she was looking over the bills it came to her attention that I had been overcharging her for sometime. She worked out roughly how much money I overcharged her and went to her mother with this number. They are now calling me an asshole for stealing her hard earned money and are demanding I return the money. I don't think its fair to call it hard earned when most of it is inheritance from her fathers passing. I had her best interest in mind and think i was just teaching her how the world works, so AITA?

EDIT: thank you everyone for your helpful suggestions, i will be putting the sum she estimated I overcharged her into an account and will tell her i was saving it as a surprise. Hopefully she doesn't come across this post.

A response to some common themes in the comments, i would like to make it clear i have never cleaned my home and will not be starting now. I do not like the noise of the vacuum or the smell of cleaning products. Maybe i went to far by saying i have no love for my step children. I want to make it clear that i like them they just annoy me as they're not my blood.

EDIT 2: you all need to get a life

"AITA for telling my boyfriend to get his beard done I (24F) keep telling my boyfriend (33M) to get his beard done, not because it’s too long or because I don’t like beards, but because it’s patchy and makes him look unkempt.

Let me start from the beginning. When we first started dating, I noticed this about him but didn’t say anything because it was too early, and honestly, he’s still an attractive man. About a month into dating, he mentioned that he’d been thinking about going to the barber. That was my chance to agree and encourage him a bit, so I said, “Yeah, that’d be great!” But he didn’t get it done for months. He constantly said “Oh I’ll do it, I’ll do it” but never did. 

I brought it up a few times after that, but each time he got more irritated. It usually started as a joke, but I could tell his mood would drop right after. At one point, he told me that me mentioning it so often made him feel insecure and like he wasn’t enough.

After that, I stopped saying anything for a while and I apologised. Eventually, I mentioned it just once and he actually went and got it done. He looked so good, as I predicted. But now it’s been two months, and we’re back to square one. I know it’s not about time or money, I just think he doesn’t like doing it.

I recently suggested that he get rid of the sideburns completely and go for more of a faded goatee since the sides are where it’s patchiest to which he isn’t sure about and said it’s too much. 

For context, my boyfriend has more of a body neutral mindset. He wears the same outfit every day, uses one moisturiser for his whole body and face, doesn’t really look in the mirror, and generally doesn’t care much about grooming. So even before we dated, he didn’t get his beard done often or at all.

That’s fine, and we’ve talked about it, but the beard really bothers me. I know he’d look amazing if he had it done properly because he has a great jawline and features. The more he doesn’t, the more I feel unseen, because he knows it’s important to me.

It’s important to me that a man has basic hygiene and puts some effort into his appearance, especially because I do the same. I don’t think that’s a double standard, I just want him to care a little. It feels unfair that I put in effort to look good and he won’t even trim his beard.

I don’t want to keep nagging him about it, but if I stay quiet, I just end up staring at it and getting annoyed.

"AITA for Skipping my Biological Daughters Graduation to Attend my Potential Step Kids Instead I (41M) have an ex which I have 3 children with, one of which recently had her high school graduation. My daughter Angie(17F, late birthday) invited me to her graduation, and I’d said I’d be there. I am currently in a committed relationship to my girlfriend of a few months (41F), who has a daughter Lauren (24F). Lauren recently graduated with a bachelors in biology.

A week before the graduations, I was then given an invite by my girlfriend and Lauren to her graduation. Her father passed away and she told me it would mean the world to have someone there to support her in his place. I agreed before learning what the date and time of the event was.

Day of the graduation, I’m getting ready to head over to Angie and her mothers house to head off to the ceremony. My girlfriend asks me why I’m getting ready to early, so I explain its in two hours, got an hours drive and want to make sure I’m there on time so I don’t hold them up, as well as travel time to the venue - then she cuts me off to say that she had no idea that was today, and told me today was also Laurens graduation. Laurens ceremony was 3 hours after the start time of Angie's graduation. I did some math and figured I had time to at least be partially present for Angie’s graduation, give her the gift I had for her, and take some pictures beforehand, but my girlfriend was not too happy with the idea. Stating it would be devastating if I didn’t keep my promise to Lauren, and that I wouldn’t be “stepfather material” if I blew her off like that. I tried to explain I'd still be there for the entirety of Laurens ceremony with this plan but she just wouldn't listen, but wouldn't give me any reason why either besides just me ""owing it to her"" and her daughter.

I let that get the best of me and gave Angie a call, told her I was having issues with my car and wouldn’t be able to attend, however I would see her as soon as I could to get the gifts and take her out to dinner to celebrate with me. I went to Lauren's ceremony later in the day. Of course I was in some of the pictures, which were posted on Facebook and I was tagged in them. My wife, and probably Angie too, saw the photos on my page.

My ex wife is livid, saying I betrayed my daughter and blew her off for some other kid I barely know or have any responsibility for. I tried to play it off like we took Laurens car there but she didn’t listen. She said I could have done better, could’ve done more, with stuff like uber and lyft I could’ve gotten a ride if I cared enough to see her and pay the fees but I just decided not to and I don’t deserve to be in her life anymore. Angie isn’t responding to my calls to set up our agreed upon dinner date to celebrate her achievement. AITA, or are they just blowing things out of proportion ? I can understand how not even bothering to attend partially would make me TA, but I figured planning a day just for her separately would make up for that, am I wrong?

Edit : me and Angie were never close. She's what I considered my ""different/boring"" child. Always on her phone around me, we never shared any interests, its not like we were buddy buddy. Angie always had social problems. I am quite close to Lauren. Shes very funny and outgoing, enjoys engaging in conversation/debate with me. - Added since someone said I barely knew Lauren.

"AITA for telling the school that my son is their responsibility while he is there? I have a son (12M), who is a bit of a trouble maker at school. My wife and I are going through a divorce currently, and it has been very difficult on him. He is the youngest of three, and has always been more malicious/mischievous than my other two kids (his older siblings). We would occasionally get calls from school, something that never happened with my other two kids, but it was nothing serious or physical so I didn't worry about it. 

Unfortunately, since the divorce process has started, his behavior at school has gotten very bad. I get calls while I'm at work at least once a week saying that he just got into a fight and I'm required to pick him up. If I don't pick up or have my phone near me, my wife will get the call. Last week I got called twice, one saying that he got involved in a prank, and another related to fighting. Him and this other kid don't get along at all from what I've heard. 

Now I don't mind picking him up if a fight occurs and he is required to leave school. However, what is annoying is that I will get calls for minor incidents such as pranks or things that don't involve anything physical/anyone getting hurt. I get annoyed because I will be at work, and see that the school is calling. As a result, there are times when they will call me just to inform what happened, which don't require me to pick him up.

The other day one of those minor incidents happened. This time they called saying that he was involved in an incident where two groups were throwing insults at each other and cursing. They also kept asking what is occurring at home and asked a load of other questions. I told them that while my kid is at school on their campus, it is their responsibility to manage and discipline them based on the school policy. I then reminded them to stop calling me so many times because I'll be at work and it becomes a nuisance. At the end I said if he needs to be picked up, let me know, or else don't call me for such small incidents. 

My wife claims that we should deal with the situation better, and essentially let the school know the situation that is occurring. I then told her that the divorce is none of their business, and they shouldn't call and complain about my son when he's their responsibility while i'm not there. I also told her that the school staff should actually try and enforce rules instead of constantly calling parents.",Asshole,1adma69
"AITA For Lying To My Son About Our Financial Situation? I 45(F) recently got into a fight with my 22(M) son about the fact that myself and my husband allowed him to take out student loans to pay for his college when we are in fact actually very wealthy. To give some context, when our son was born my husband and I agreed we wouldn't spoil him and keep our considerable wealth a secret. My husband is a lawyer and I'm a dentist. Despite us living in a big house we often told him we couldn't afford many of the things he asked for due to our mortgage or other loans we had to pay off. We didn't buy the used car he us begged for on his 16th birthday because he was asking us to pay for more than half of it. He had a job, but always spent his money straight away. We wanted to teach him the value of saving. Over time, my husband started to feel guilty and whenever I wasn't around would buy our son things he wanted without informing me. When our son graduated high school, he approached us and asked us if we could assist him with college tuition. I told him that we couldn't help him due to our mortgage, even though we never had one. For 4 years my son had to work through college, often sacrificing his social life. One evening after graduating college, he came to surprise us for dinner one night where one of our good friends was eating with us and his father asked him about college and if he had enjoyed his time there. He told him no, he never had the time due to work and studying but didn't hold it against due to our financial situation. The friend then says ""Oh I didn't know you were having financial trouble, what about that vacation spot you were gonna buy?"". Our son then looked up at us with confused face and said ""You guys can afford vacation home? How?"". There was a silence as I looked at my husband, begging him not to say anything. My husband stupidly decides to admit to our son that I came up with the idea to conceal how wealthy we were and to force our son to work for everything he has, even though we could've made his life easier by helping out with tuition, and accommodation and later his student loans. My son asks about our mortgage to which my husband replies, we never had one. Our son then recounts all the times we denied him ""joy"" due to our not being able to afford a vacation home and asks if it was all a lie. This is when I spoke for the first time and I said ""Yes, but I only came up with this idea so we could raise you as a humble person who knew the value of hard work"". He proceeds to drop his fork and tell me he never wants to see me again. He walks out the door and nearly slams it off it's hinges. It's been 2 weeks now and he refuses to answer my calls. He does call his dad but whenever I tried to speak he hung up. I still don't think I'm in the wrong and don't think it's fair our son still speaks to my husband but not me.

"AITA for making my daughter and her boyfriend respect my house My husband (65) and I (60) live in Spain. Our daughter (25) and her long term boyfriend (26) come to visit us once or twice a year. Our house is split into two apartments so they get their own space when staying with the understanding we might need to pop in to grab stuff from the pantry, kitchen etc. We strongly encourage them to do stuff in the local area like go to beach when visiting so they're not just hanging out in the lounge with us as they come for a week at a time. 

On one of these days they'd gone for a walk in the village and I needed some bedding from the wardrobe in their room. Well when I went in I was shocked, they hadn't unpacked their suitcase properly and had a pile of clothes on the chair next to the desk. Some of their things were hanging in the wardrobe but not all. There was a pile of dirty washing under the chair and shoes scattered on the floor. Which is risky here as we can get scorpions. They each had a glass of water that had been partially drunk on the bed side table and the bed wasn't made properly. When I went into the kitchen they'd left all the dishes they'd used at breakfast on the draining rack and there was a half drunk bottle of cola on the side. The bathroom was no better. Wet towels bunched up on the drying radiator and wet swimwear hanging in the shower. 

When they got back my husband and I sat them down and told them how rude and how disrespectful they'd been to our house and us as hosts. We made them unpack fully and get rid of the mess, but not before they took everything off the floor and vacuumed the carpet in the bedroom, dry and put away the dishes in the kitchen and tidy up the bathroom.

"AITA for banning my sister from family parties because of her attitude towards kids? I 41M am the oldest of five. My sister, Vera (31F) is the third child. Our parents are long dead.

Now, my sister was always the quiet one, she never interacted with us much as a child, instead, she spent most time in her room, reading. She barely spoke and when she did, she had different conversation topics. She was gifted, I get it, but we were kids and got bored when she talked so we just didn't get along.

Fast forward, Vera nos works optimizing administrative processes for big companies. She's very authoritative, strategic and overconfident. Even her boyfriend would not take a business or financial decision without consulting her first because he's convinced she's the holy grial of management. I get it, she's good at what she does, has a big salary, and has good connections, but she's just a bit much.

One point here is that Vera is the only sibling who has no kids and apparently her boyfriend got a vasectomy a few months ago. Good for him.

Thing is, when we gather at our childhood home all my siblings bring along their kids, kids are kids, they are loud and like to play. They are sensitive too.

Vera doesn't seem to understand this, she greets the kids from a distance, never hugs them and if one of them comes to her she will keep them at arm length, will be polite but way too serious and somehow cold with them. Neither my siblings nor me like this, or the way she will refuse to do ""uppies"" with the toddlers or just refuse to play along with the older kids who want to make questions, or just talk like kids do. Let alone will watch the kids even for 15 minutes (would not ask more from her).

Anyway, her behavior got worse after the last family gathering. She brought along her laptop because she had some work to do, and one of the kids dropped it accidentally, damaging the screen. She went totally ballistic and demanded my youngest sister (who is a single mom living on welfare at the moment) paid the repair. After some reasoning she dropped the subject, but then, she proceeded to stay even further away from the kids.

Hence, I spoke to my siblings and concluded it was best if we didn't invite her over for the next gathering, that was this weekend. I knew she would see the photos on Instagram, but I so hoped she would see how her attitude had isolated her and would learn a lesson.

Boy, I was wrong. She sent me a short, dead cold message asking why she wasn't invited, I told her the reason and told her we expected her to behave like a member of the family if she wanted to be treated like family. She responded ""Okay"" and proceeded to block us everywhere. Not only her, her boyfriend did too. Apparently she also blocked other members of our family who proceeded to send angry audios and messages to me and my siblings about it

AITA?, just wanted to keep the kids on a friendly environment and expected her to be an adult",Asshole,1dn705a
"AITA for taking a little time to myself in the mornings? My wife (30f) Lara and I (35m) have 2 children, ages 2 and 3.5 and have been married for 5 years.

Lara is a sahm to our boys and takes the boys 3 days a week to take care of her grandmother who has dementia, the other 4 days a nurse comes in. I work in retail management. My typical schedule is 1pm-10pm with a one hour lunch if I choose to take it. 

I live about 45 minutes from my job and I like to head out a bit early, get a coffee and quick bite and send some emails from a cafe before walking into work. This means I typically leave the house between 8:30-9am in the mornings. After work I'm often frustrated so I stop by the 24 hour gym I'm a member at and run the treadmill or lift weights for a bit. This puts be getting home at 12 or just after. On weekends I often have things planned with family or friends that tend to use up a portion of my day.

Lara is telling me I need to stick around to help her more in the mornings. She's insisting my routine isn't all that important and I'm making her feel like a single mom. From my perspective, I enjoy my routine, I get some peace and quiet and it's a nice way for me to prepare for and end my day. Lara want me to be at home until she either leaves with the boys to her grandmother's or until it's closer to noon. If I did that I'd completely miss being able to go to the cafe and deal with emails while I mentally prepare myself for the day. She doesn't mind me going to the gym so much as she's usually asleep by the time I get home. I've offered to ask my sister or mom to come over and help her in the mornings a day or two a week but she rejected that idea. I feel like I've offered a compromise of sorts but Lara tells me I haven't. AITA",Asshole,1h0fvwt
"AITA for making my son move into a house i helped pay for? I have a daughter and 2 sons from my ex. My sons are 31 and 35 and my daughter is 29.

My eldest and daughter have their own places. My daughter lives alone in a 3 bed and has openly said she doesn't want a family and is unlikely to ever get married after having dated ah's. She owns the place and has a very good salary as she is an engineer.

My younger son is married and has a 2 year old with another kid on the way.

My elder son lived with me and doesn't work. He has struggled with depression and is significantly overweight to the point of needing help getting bathed. Because of this his health isn't the best and he can't find a job. He cannot stand for long and when he tried working fast food it didn't work out. He doesn't have a high school diploma which makes things harder.

My girlfriend has expressed wanting to move in with me but for privacy she wants my son to move out first.

Since I helped out with my daughter's down-payment I thought it would be reasonable to ask my daughter to take him in. I could tell she wasn't very happy about it but she eventually agreed. I said I'd find some hired help for bathing him.

I dropped him off there and it has only been 2 weeks and she is now upset at me and arguing with me to take him back. I haven't yet found the hired help and she is upset he hasn't bathed properly and says he is a slob and doesn't do any chores. While he does eat a lot I've not really found him to be a slob and my housekeeper hasn't ever complained about it. I think she is exagerating and her main issue is that she is embarassed of being seen with him as I know the past 2 weeks she didnt have her friends over on the weekends like she normally does and she told my niece she doesnt want to with him around.

She suggested having him go to her other brother's place but that's not realistic as he has a wife and infants and even splitting his time there would be difficult. She also lives closer to me so it is easier for me to help out.

I refused to do so and reminded her that I helped her with the down-payment.She said she'd pay me back and can do so right now if i want to but that's still help since she didnt have the funds back then and I'm not taking any interest on it.

"AITA for disliking my partner’s haircut? My boyfriend has been begging me for months to let him get a buzzcut. Personally, I hate buzzcuts. I used to not care about them, but a few years ago, I was in a very toxic relationship, and certain things bring up very bad memories. Buzzcuts, unfortunately, became one of these things. Sometimes when I see a guy with a buzzcut in public, there is always a bit of fear wondering if it’s my ex. I had addressed this to my boyfriend, but he told me that it’s just hair and that it’d grow back. I told him that if he did want to get it, I wouldn’t stop him, but I’d be very uncomfortable because of my past. I told him I’d probably be less outwardly affectionate (ex. hugs), but that it doesn’t mean I love him any less. He got very upset at the idea of me getting less distant over a haircut (imo, understandable). Today, he got a buzzcut, and I fear that I am having a bit of anxiety. I told him that i was happy he got to do what he wanted to do, but that I wouldn’t be as outwardly affectionate because the buzzcut gave me bad memories. He is now upset at me because he doesn’t understand how a buzzcut could cause someone so much distress. AITA?

Edit: I wasn’t expecting so much reaction to this post. I appreciate hearing everyone’s opinions. Yes, I am in therapy. I didn’t want to bring it up because I felt that it was irrelevant to the story, but I keep seeing the comments about therapy so I wanted to make that clear. I think a lot of people are disregarding that I still very much love my boyfriend, and a haircut isn’t gonna make me feel any less emotional love for him in any way. It’s more of the psychological feeling I have with the haircut, and the memories associated with it. I’m trying to regulate myself better, but sometimes it’s one step forward and two steps back. I am also all for the opinion of, “Trauma doesn’t allow you to do whatever you want and be an a hole.” However, there should be some level of empathy given to those who’ve experienced trauma. I have worked with people who have experienced immense trauma, and sometimes, they’ve treated me horribly. It doesn’t excuse their actions, but I always try to approach them from a place of empathy because a lot of their reactions stem from trauma responses. We may not fully understand why people react the way they do, but a little kindness and empathy can go a long way for people who are struggling. Personally, I don’t think I’m an a hole, and I don’t think my bf is an a hole. He knew from the moment I met him (I was very transparent about my past) what happened to me and why I was the way I was, and he still chose to love me regardless, and for that, I am very grateful",Asshole,1pacz07

"AITA for making my daughter give a graphics card she doesn't need to my son. I have a daughter (24F) from a previous marriage with my ex and a son (15M) from my current marriage. My ex passed away when my daughter was 16 and she has lived with me rent free ever since since I live close to her college

My daughter is a graduate student and earns money from her research lab, I don't remember how much quite well but it is an top Ivy school so it pays quite well. My daughter pays no rent, had her college paid for by scholarships and my ex's inheritance which went completely to her.

Recently my son has been wanting a new graphics card for his computer as he is an avid gamer and his current one doesn't work well with his monitor. He knows computers quite well.

My daughter recently bought herself a new computer and sold her old one in parts

According to my son my daughter's computer has two graphics cards and she isn't using one of them (the monitor is plugged in to the one she uses). The one she uses is from her old computer (5600xt) and the one she doesn't use is 4090

He says because she doesn't use windows and uses Linux the other one is useless to her and would suit his needs and he can exchange it with his current graphics card (2070).

I asked her to exchange it with her brother and she refused initially but when I reminded her about how it would be a gesture and how I don't charge her rent despite being an earning adult she reluctantly agreed but still lied and claimed she uses it despite a monitor never being plugged in.

She said she used it as it made school easier for when she is not on campus even though she plays very few games and is usually typing text documents.

However since the exchange she has been acting quite unpleasantly, not saying much and banging things when she does chores.

AITA here? I get that it is hers but I feel like if it's something that came with her computer that she doesn't use, it makes sense for her to give it to my son who would actually use it to upgrade his older computer especially since she already saves a lot on rent.",Asshole,1915s31
"AITA for complaining about the food my ex makes? For some context I (40) and my ex wife (35F) got divorced five years ago. While we were together we had twin girls. We maintain a healthy co-parent relationship and she’s doesn’t prefer to communicate outside of that.

When my wife and I were together she enjoyed making things from scratch. Mostly food but clothes as well. She would always tell me she wanted to live on a farm. I always thought that it was all a waste of money, but let it be.

Now that we’re divorced, she moved onto the farm she always wanted and grows various kinds of fruits and vegetables. She has also continued to make even more food from scratch but now feeds this food to our daughters. Apparently it makes up most of their diet.

The problem comes in when it is mealtime when I have custody of our daughters. The girls refuse to eat anything I make. I usually use store bought pasta, bread, jam, cheese, yogurt etc, all things their mother makes for scratch. They often complain about the taste and say they can taste the difference if I try and lie to them.

I talked to my ex about this a few times. Her solution was to send over a few things to give them. But I really don’t see the point in not just giving them regular food. It seems like they are developing a snobbish attitude from this. I communicated this to my ex but she keeps saying it’s healthier and that she isn’t going to keep arguing with me. She also offered to teach me to make a few things but I told her I wasn’t going to waste my time or money making anything from scratch

I asked her to stop feeding the girls that food and she told me to grow up. So now I think I’m an asshole because she doesn’t get mad this easily.",Asshole,1exx6ey
"WIBTA for printing out and highlighting an argument with a friend to force her to read what I'm saying? I (27NBi) have been in an argument with a friend (31F) for about 3 months now.



For background, we both help another friend home school her 11 year old son. I'm currently studying my Master of Teaching. My friend, we'll call her Emily, teaches art classes on the weekend.  I'm teaching the child English and HASS, Emily is teaching art and her partner (32NBi) is teaching maths. The goal was to get him re-engaged with education.



Emily was used to teaching people who had paid to be there. She didn't know how to teach someone who didn't want to be there. She would basically tell him if he didn't he would have a consequence.

At first, I tried to tell her gently that her approach won't help him learn. She kept brushing me off, so I started to get more direct. She started shutting me down harder.



About 3 months ago, she said in the group chat that she had told the kid he was being ""manipulative,"" and he got upset. Her partner commented that manipulative can have neutral and positive connotations, to which she agreed.



I said that manipulative is a word that is generally negative. Emily wrote: ""OP. It's sorted. We've moved on.""  I said that while it's sorted this time, what about next time? I said that it was shitty she was blaming the kid for everything, while refusing to look at her own behaviour. It ended with Emily calling me cruel for coming in with anger and insults and told me to ""enjoy my moment.""



At 10pm, I got a message from Emily. It was about 5 paragraphs long, telling me that I had been bullying her for months, giving her small comments about her appearance. I remember telling her if her lipstick smudged, or if her shirt was undone. Things that she had expressed she'd prefer that I tell her. She also said that I was criticising her teaching.



I responded to all her points, basically saying I felt she was being unfair for not telling me about the insults and deflecting from what I've been trying to tell her about her teaching.



I said I'd like to see a councellor. She said ""if you feel it's necessary."" I said I do, because I don't feel like she's open to listening to anything I'm saying. She said she's not, and she was worried that I was just going to brush off all accountability. I said ok, I'm done. There's no moving forward if her voice is the only one.



Later in the week, she sent me a message saying that she didn't say that she was against counselling, only that she only wanted to do it if I thought we needed to. She's not against hearing me, but first she needs me to go to therapy and get control of my ""anger issues"". I said I don't meet the definition of anger issues. She said I did.



That was 3 months ago. In that time, I've seen therapists and all of them suggest cutting her off and moving on. We've been friends for the last 10 years and she's the cornerstone of one of my main friend groups. WIBTA if I did what I said in the title?",Asshole,1lt0kc2

"AITA i let a girl cry because she tought i was stalking her. I'm 14M and live in the Netherlands, so i cycle to school and back. There is this one girl in my class, we don't really talk with each other, but i see her regularly because she lives on my way home. Most of the time i catch up with her, but sometimes i stay behind her, cause i'm tired and don't want to cycle hard.

So one day after school i get called to an office, when i came in i saw my mentor and that girl sitting. I was really confused ofc, cause i don't know her that well so why was i there? Then my mentor said that that girl didn't feel safe when she was cycling home, because she thought i was stalking her and that she would appreciate if i changed my way home. At first i laughed it off, thinking it was a weird kind of humor, but when they kept looking serious at me i said: 'Wait you're serious? ofc im not stalking her! Why would I? She lives on my way home and if i had to change my route back home i need to cycle way longer!' But my mentor made it very clear that she would take measures if i didn't change my route. Then i got really mad and said/yelled. 'Listen, I don't care what she does or where she lives, i don't stalk her! Why would i stalk her, I don't even have a crush on her. (at this moment i turned to girl) I don't have a crush on you, hell you wouldn't even be in my top 15!' At that moment she began to cry, i didn't know what to do, so i walked away.

Now i get why se may think i was stalking her, and it is a little creepy to get followed by a guy as a girl. And i made her cry when i said that she wasn't even in my top 15.

"AITA for expensing everything to my uncle for traveling to his son's wedding after he offered to ""cover my trip"" Throw away for obvious reasons, no one in my family uses Reddit but I still don't want to post this from my real account

Okay, so let me start off by saying that nobody in my family, immediate or not immediate, has any real money. But we are okay we all get by. I've been living on my own for a while now, my parents don't really have enough money to help out, and that's fine I'm old enough that I should be independent at this point in my life.

My first cousin, who I've always been really close with, I think it's fair to say we are almost bff status, got engaged a while back to a nice girl, really happy for him, and I was one of the first phone calls. A little while later he called me up and said, hey, you're coming to my wedding, right? I was like, yeah, sure, what are the details? Then he told me that, oh, it's in LA. Well, I live in New York and I really can't afford that. Plus, I don't have the time off and my work is real strict about that. So I apologetically explained to him that I was not going to be able to make it. He was really unhappy. BTW it's a basic wedding she just is from there

He kept trying to get me to reconsider, but I kept telling him that it wasn't going to happen. So his dad calls &amp; is like yeah well your parents are coming, and i said that's great for them but i'm not asking them to cover my ticket and i can't afford it.

anyways he was not happy about that. A couple of weeks ago he called me up, Matt really wants you at his wedding. So how about this If I cover the trip will you come? And I said, you know what? Fine. So I'm not an a-hole. I went and I found the cheapest tickets. And keeping a log of how much was costing me. Plane ticket, uber to and from the airport both ways. time off. Hotel. Etc, etc. After everything was done, I emailed my uncle and I'm like, here's a list of how much everything cost. He called me up and he was like, what's all that stuff? And I'm like, what do you mean? That's how much everything costs. He seemed really upset and I honestly did not get why. He was like, so like, how much of that am I covering? I'm like, what do you mean? You offered to pay for me to come? So he sends me the money.

Now I'm catching tons of crap from my immediate family and my cousins who are all piling on me. They're all like, you know he obviously meant that he was going to cover your plane ticket, you know he can't afford that, he meant if he covered your plane ticket would you come! That's not how I understood it. So now I am wondering if I should feel stupid about this. I guess I have several questions:

AITA for not wanting to go even though a lot of my relatives were spending a lot of their own time and money to go

AITA for assuming that he would cover every single expense related to the trip

AITA for taking all that money from him

should I give it back?

I genuinely can't even say if I would have gone if I would have known that's what he meant.

"AITA For Telling My Niece I'm Disappointed In Her? I (31f) have a lot of family members all together for the holidays, my parents (64f and 68m) and three older sisters: 

""Amelia"" (39f) married ""Andrew"" (42m) and has ""Ada"" (13f) and ""Alice"" (8f).  

""Beth"" (34f) married ""Bradley"" (32m) and has ""Bella"" (9f), ""Brooke"" (7f), and ""Benjamin"" (4m).  

""Cynthia"" (32f) married ""Chris"" (33m) and has ""Caleb"" (5m) and ""Connor"" (1m).  

And I am married ""David"" (31m) and have ""Delia"" (1f).  

My parents wanted all 16 of us over for the holidays. I remember really enjoying my childhood time with Amelia, who was old enough to babysit me by the time I could form memories. I know that Ada's a responsible girl and has recently been taking babysitting training at her school, so I asked early on into the holidays if she would like to watch Delia. She confirmed that she would and has been doing a wonderful job. 

Ada's taken more and more responsibility over the cousins, and now handles their breakfasts, lunches, snacks, and entertainment and does a good job with the babies' naps and bottles. It's been wonderful for us. 

For the first time the other day myself, my sisters, and our respective husbands decided to go for a nice hike and just left Ada and the children alone with my parents. While we were out, Caleb and Benjamin had gotten into the pantry, eaten a ton of candy, got really hyper and were annoying Bella, Brooke, and Alice. Ada responded by locking Caleb and Benjamin into the bedroom her and Alice are staying in as a time-out. Ada was then distracted with the babies. In the mean time, Caleb had started crying because his stomach hurt and ended up vomiting because of all the candy, all over this blanket Ada's had since she was little and is very attached to. She takes good care of it and was distressed to see how messy it had gotten. 

My parents were shouting at the kids to calm down, which also was not helping the situation. Cynthia and Beth were upset with Ada leaving Caleb and Benjamin alone for some unspecified amount of time in a locked room to vomit. I was annoyed at Ada for messing up the childcare on the one day none of the parents were there--she has had days of supervised practice, effectively, and chose to mess up the day we had all went on a hike? Ada was crying because she was really upset over her blanket but also embarrassed to be so attached to a blanket. 

I told Ada that I was disappointed in her. I told her that she ought to know better from her trainings and, if she wants to make money off of it, she's going to have to manage multiple kids. Ada then started crying again and Amelia told me that I was being an annoying younger sister and I would never understand how hard it is to be the eldest. I don't know what that has to do with anything--if Ada didn't think she could handle the children, she should have spoken up at the beginning. We had all trusted her and she had disappointed. But that might also be to hard of a stance for me to look at a 13 year old with, so I was wondering AITA?",Asshole,zzeye3
"AITA for not dressing in black tie for my gf's Christmas party? I (21M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been dating for nearly a year now. She studies at a university in a different city to me so we've been long distance for a significant part of our relationship. I finished uni last year but she has one more year to go, so I am living at home and working 2 jobs while she finishes her studies. We obviously don't get to see each other very often so when we do, it's a really special time.

Last week, I was missing her a lot and decided to surprise her with a weekend visit. I booked a flight with just a small cabin bag to save on costs and packed only the essentials (t-shirts, underwear) and some small gifts I’d been collecting for her over the semester. I coordinated with her friend, who loved the idea and told me about a Christmas soirée—a black-tie party—planned for the night I’d arrive.

Here’s where things went wrong: I didn’t wear a tux to the party. After nearly a day of working and traveling, I just wanted to be comfortable and just didn’t feel like dressing up fancy, so on my train from the airport I put on a black dress shirt and a (literal) black tie as a funny nod to the theme while still being slightly more comfortable. 

When I arrived, her friend let me in, and my girlfriend seemed happy to see me. She hugged me and asked why I was there, and I told her that me and her friend had hatched this plan for me to crash the party. She then got upset at her friend for not making sure I knew to dress up. I jumped in immediately and told her that I was told about the party, but decided not to dress up fancy because I was packing light and didn’t want to have to be uncomfortable while travelling.

Then, she started to flip out on me. I tried to reassure her that it wasn’t a big deal, it was just a party and no one cared that I wasn’t dressed up. This made her even more mad and she accused me of ‘invalidating her feelings’ and ‘ruining her night’ by embarrassing her in front of all her friends. I tried to keep a level head during all this, but then she did something that tipped me over the edge. She took the flowers I had brought her, threw them on the floor, and stomped on them, completely trashing them. Admittedly, I lost it. I told her she was being a disrespectful AH for how she reacted, that I had put so much time and effort into this trip, and that she was being crazy for expecting even more out of me. 

She argued that I was holding the effort I had put in over her and that I dismissed her feelings by not putting in just a little more effort to dress appropriately. I told her she was being childish and immature over something so small and she stormed out. Her housemate told me it was probably best for me to leave so I went to stay with my brother who also lives in her city. She hasn't spoken to me since, despite multiple attempts on my part to contact her.

So AITA? I know dressing up wouldn’t have been that hard, but I thought my effort to visit her would matter more.",Asshole,1h6wlhu

"AITA for making a small joke about my wife's bisexuality? Hey everyone. I (34M) am married to Angela (36F). Angela is bisexual, and while I'm genuinely not bothered by it or anything, I do like to make a joke out of her sexuality every now and then. It's never malicious, and she usually just laughs along. However, this past summer, I went on a tour of a US Navy base with Angela, our 5-year old adopted daughter, and Angie's 29-year-old sister. We went down to a submarine, and our daughter was freaking out about how cool it was, and we all had a good time. However, while we were using the ladder to get out of the sub, Angie's sister went up right before Angie. And her sister was wearing a skirt that day (with running shorts underneath, however), and my wife looked up and got a view up her own sister's skirt while we were making our way up the ladder. After we got out of the sub, I jokingly asked my wife ""did you enjoy the view?"" My wife took a second to process the joke, and then she said ""excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?"" She forced me to explain the joke right there, right in front of our daughter, which I didn't really appreciate.

The aftermath of it is that after our Navy tour, Angela spent a few days at her parents' house because she was so upset about my joke. We did later reconcile, and although we're all living under one roof now, there is a bit of an uneasy atmosphere these days. In any case, I've stopped making jokes about my wife's bisexuality.

Edited: to add that my wife naturally has a sense of humor about her sexuality, and she subscribes to subs like /r/bi_irl and doesn't mind self-deprecating jokes.

Also edited to add that I made that joke in front of my daughter, because she wouldn't have understood it. That's why I didn't have a problem with making the joke in front of her, but I did resent having to explain it in front of her.

Last edit I'll make: While my wife was upset about the joke I made, I was also upset at her for not being graceful and making a big deal out of it. She didn't need to pack her bags and spend a few nights at her parents' house.",Asshole,18ihmtz
"AITA for apologizing to my mom on behalf of my wife so we could have a smooth Family Day meet up? My wife and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a seven month old toddler. We've both gotten along with our respective in-laws really well and have never really had any issues.

Last week my wife and my mom had gotten into a verbal spat regarding not sending photos of our son to her,  (apparently my MIL had forwarded some photos of a while back) and my mom was bothered that she hadn't received them. I wasn't there when the call happened, and heard two very different sides of the story. According to my wife my mom had said that it's her right as a grandmother to  be kept in the loop and my wifes duty to do so. According to my mom, she said she just would like to be included and would also like to be sent photos if possible.

We had a Family Day weekend (got cut short due to the weather) hangout planned with my sister and her family. My sister took my mom's side, we talked and it was clear she thought my wife was in the wrong. On Wednesday I was talking to my mom, the whole argument got rehashed and it just slipped out from my mouth that my wife was really sorry about what was said. I then pressed my mom to bury the hatchet too. My sister learned about it and was cool with it too.

Our get-together at my sister's went well, and everyone was cordial. When we got back my wife said she was pleasantly surprised at how welcoming my sister was, all things considered. She then asked me if I had said anything. I said I'd pressed everyone to get over it. She asked if I'd apologized on her behalf, I said yes that it slipped out but I ran with it. She got extremely angry, said she regrets going, and now wants me to either make it clear that she's not sorry, or she won't be meeting my mom or sister anymore. I think now that everyone has gotten over it, what good could that do? I do get her pov that she feels I shouldn't have spoken on her behalf but I just thought this was I'm the one who actually ended up apologizing and everyone got past it. AITA?",Asshole,1iqidzp
"AITA for telling my wife to stop crying at Home Depot? My wife 27F and I 27M have been making trips to Home Depot to renovate our backyard. It's become a little ""date"" for us and we enjoy the quality time. In March of 2022, my father in law (FIL) suddenly passed away from a heart attack. I am very close with my wife's family and supported her through the grieving process.

On Sunday, my wife insisted I skip NFL and go to Home Depot with her, as our order was ready for pickup.When we got to Home Depot, there was an extremely long lineup, so I'm already annoyed having to wait.

Out of absolutely nowhere, my wife starts tearing up and crying in the middle of this long line. I ask her what's wrong and she quietly tells me that the gentleman at the end of the line reminds her of her late father (my FIL) and she became very emotional and continues to cry. I got upset / embarrassed and told her to quit being so random since it's a weird reason to cry, especially because the gentleman looks absolutely nothing like her father.

I then told her she is tripping out for no reason and she ruined the vibe for home depot dates.

On the car ride home she called me insensitive and said it's not my right to talk about her father, even though it was obvious the home depot customer / employee looked nothing like my father-in-law. If it was a doppleganger I would understand.",Asshole,16ibx1x
"AITAH for borrowing my neighbors patio furniture for a party?? Everyone involved is in their 50s. I hosted a big backyard get together last weekend for my wife’s birthday, about 30 people. We live in a suburban neighborhood where most houses have good sized yards. Everyone in the neighborhood has a friendly relationship but not necessarily super close.

My nextdoor neighbor named Glen travels a lot for work. His backyard is really nice, really nice patio furniture, umbrellas, propane firepit, etc. I’ve complimented it before and helped him haul the furniture in once during a storm, so I feel like we’re on good terms. He's also borrowed shovels, rakes, etc. we've had in the yard when we weren't home, letting us know later. No problem, no biggie. 

The day before the party, I realized we didn’t have enough seating. Rental companies were all booked (first nice weekend of spring here), and we didn’t want people standing around. Glen was out of town (car gone, lights were off for days), and his gate was unlocked. I figured it wouldn’t be a huge deal to temporarily move a few of his chairs and one of his smaller tables into our yard for the party, to be returned ASAP. We took care not to damage anything, wiped it all down afterwards and put it back exactly where it was the next morning (or so I thought, must not have been exactly where though for what follows). I didn’t think anything of it.

Monday, Glen knocked on my door looking pissed. He asked if we’d taken his stuff. I told him we had, explained why, emphasized that nothing was harmed (and that obviously we would have asked if he was home). He told me that was completely out of line and I quote ""a massive invasion of his property"" even though nothing was broken/missing.

I tried to smooth things over, said it wasn’t like we were strangers and that if the roles were reversed (as in the past with things he'd borrowed when we weren't around), I wouldn’t have cared. He said that was irrelevant and now he doesn’t want us on his property at all. My wife and I think he’s being dramatic, but obviously he's upset for a reason so maybe there's something I'm not seeing.

"AITA for snapping at my daughters for wasting so much time in the bath tub? My wife 37f had to help her friend move into a new place yesterday and it was a long drive there and back so I 37m was in charge of our kids 10m, 8f, and 7f all day yesterday. 


Our daughters always take their bath together and my wife says they spend the entire time playing in the tub and not actually getting clean so she has to go in there frequently and wash their hair and make sure they're actually getting clean and I would probably have to do the same. 

I reminded the girls a few times during their bath that they needed to actually wash themselves and not just play the whole time, each time they said "" okay Daddy"" and I ( mistakenly) took their word for it. 

After reminding them 3 times while busy with other things and getting a bit stressed out, I realized they had been in the tub for almost 2 hours so I went up and checked on them and they still had just been playing. 

I got upset and took away all the bath toys and told them to stop playing and wash their hair and that I would be back in 20 minutes to get then out of the tub. 

When I got back they were still just playing by splashing each other in the tub. This was when I snapped and yelled at them for wasting time and not washing their hair. 

As soon as I did it I felt bad and they were both scared by it which made me feel worse. I washed their hair for them and told them it was because they clearly weren't big enough to do so themselves.

When my wife got home I told her what happened and she got mad. She asked me what it was I expected for them to just wash themselves without getting distracted by play at their ages? And  reminded me how she told me I would need to check on them quite frequently and make sure they got clean so I would be prepared to do so and something like this wouldn't have happened if I had listened to her.

"AITA for wanting my son to have a more traditional wedding to reflect on his career choice? I had a complicated birth with my youngest son matt and I have always had high expectations for him. 

Matt is still in law school but is still insisting on getting married this October. I’m  not the biggest fan of his fiancee Amy’s ideas for her wedding . She decides she wanted a Halloween marriage and Amy doesn’t care how it looks infront of matt’s peers and professors and other people in his conservative field once he finishes law school. Amy picked out black dress and somehow got it in her head that she wants to wear ruby slippers tp the wedding since she love wicked. 

I have repeatedly tried to tell amy to have some respect for matt’s future field but Amy thinks it’s okay because she does marketing and some of her coworkers are coming to this disaster of a wedding. 

My oldest daughter dropped out of being a bridesmaid before Amy wanted the in red dresses and my daughter thinks amy is being tacky and matt still won’t do anything about the wedding and making it more traditional. 

I tried to talk to him again after the ruby slippers issue and he told me maybe if his wedding stresses me out so much I should skip it. I tried explaining that this kind of tackiness can backfire on his career because when he has wedding pictures up people are going to notice his bride in a black dress and question his integrity as lawyer.

"AITA (or are we the assholes) for ""ganging up on our friend""? I (23F) recently visited my former college roommate, “Brooke” (24F), who moved out of state after graduation. Our other roommate, “Gwen” (24F), also joined. Brooke now lives with her boyfriend, “David” (28M), and Gwen and I stayed at their apartment. It wasn’t our first time meeting David, but it was Gwen’s first time spending extended time with him.

During the first few days, David tagged along on our outings. I like him—he can be a bit curmudgeonly, but I just sass him back, and he’s fine with it. I noticed Gwen seemed uncomfortable, and she eventually pulled me aside to say she felt weird that David was always around. She’d expected more time with just the three of us. I told her it wasn’t a big deal since it’s David’s apartment too. Gwen clarified she didn’t expect him to leave his own space, just not join every outing.

On Day 4, just us girls went out while David drove us. Gwen’s attitude completely changed—she was her bubbly self again. While she was in the bathroom, Brooke commented on Gwen’s mood shift, and I shared what Gwen had said. Later at dinner, Gwen mentioned how nice it was being just the three of us. Brooke replied that David needed to be included too since it’s his place. Gwen, a bit taken aback, said she never wanted him to leave his own home—just thought he wouldn’t join every daytime activity. Brooke got defensive, accusing Gwen of not liking David. Gwen said it wasn’t about disliking him, just that his rough-around-the-edges personality made her anxious, and she really expected more ""us time"".

I stepped in and said David is part of Brooke’s life, and if Gwen wants to be part of that, she needs to accept it. Brooke appreciated my support, but Gwen just agreed and changed the subject. After that, Gwen seemed to go out of her way to be nice to David, but it felt forced.

At the airport, Gwen was quiet and admitted the trip wasn’t what she expected and felt ganged up on. She said she tried to make the most of it but didn’t appreciate being called out for feeling uncomfortable. I told her she was the one acting weird. Since then, Gwen has been distant from both of us. When I recounted the story to my boyfriend, he sided with Gwen, saying he wouldn’t have intruded on my time with friends and that it did seem like we ganged up on her.

"AITA for calling my child lazy? I (39F) and my husband (40M) have 4 kids together, L who is 21, T who is 17, B who is 14, and R who is 9. This story focuses on T.

T has never been much of a good kid, but we still loved and supported them any way we could, loving them unconditionally. They suffer from ADHD, like my husband. The difference is that T uses it as an excuse for everything. Didn't do a chore? They're ""forgetful"". They fall behind in school? They can't sit still or focus. 

A bit over a week ago, my kids got out for Christmas break and T has done nothing but lay in bed for most of the week on their phone. If they aren't laying down, they lounging around the living room or going out to the store or to school to catch up on work (they have that opportunity at their school). They only get up out of bed at around 11 am after I tell them to. Their only chore is to wash dishes, but they hardly do that.

Today, I was fed up with not having room in the kitchen and I yelled at T to get up. Once they came out of their room, I scolded them about the dishes and how they never do them, calling them lazy and ungrateful. They did end up doing them, but they had an attitude the whole time. 

After they washed a load of dishes, they went back to their room to clean up a bit. My husband said I was a bit of an asshole for calling T lazy, as they do have stuff going on at school as well, drumline (?) being one of them, but I disagree. I was simply calling it as I saw it, and what I saw was laziness.

Before we started dating I could kinda sign but since we started dating I have been trying to get better. I occasionally make mistakes he says but he says he completely understands me and I translate for him 99% of the time.

Recently we went to a movie theater. We were signing as we went up to the counter to order food, and as we went to the employee he started signing to us. I immediately spoke and said I am hearing hes deaf. He apologized both in english and ASL. Everything else the employee said he did in both languages. He said oh I'm very sorry, I saw the two of you signing and assumed you were both deaf. Did he/do you want to order (referring to my bf) or will she order. He signed that he would order and told him what he wanted. I then told him what I wanted and after the movie I was a little angry and asked him why he ordered. He signed that if the employee knew ASL he could just order it would be easier. I signed but I was there I could help. I signed that I was practicing ASL just for him and that he should let me use it. He signed that he was not incompetent and that if he can directly talk to the employee why not. I signed that it would be nice to let me help. He signed that he only wants help when he needs it if its not needed I'm just being condescending and rude.

"AITA for throwing away my boyfriend's hat? Hello.

I(19F) have been dating ""Josh""(20m) for about a year and a half.

Very unfortunately, Josh's grandfather had passed away about a year ago due to cancer.

This left Josh absolutely torn. In the beginning, he couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep, he barely ever talked to anybody and his grades started to drop a bit. His grandfather was basically like his dad (his dad walked out on him when he was 10) and those two were inseparable. I felt so bad seeing him like this, knowing there was nothing I could do.

As of now, he is doing a lot better. But whenever there are any reminders of his grandfather, he breaks down all over again. And when he does, he's all depressed for about a week before he starts to recover all over again.

Now comes that damn hat.

His grandfather wore that baseball hat all the time. During his last few breaths, he gave that hat to Josh. Now that hat is his prized possession. Whenever he sees it, again, he breaks down.

I've tried and tried to stop getting him to look at that thing but he just keeps doing it and reminding himself. Whenever he does, all the work we put into getting him to cheer up again just goes down the drain.

I was just sick of that hat so one day when he was showering, I snuck it into my bag. When I left, I threw it into the garbage.

He called me 2 days later in a complete panic, asking if I've seen it. I thought about lying but decided to fess up. He completely broke down harder than he ever has recently, asking how I could do something so awful and claiming that I 'ruined his life'. I started crying too, trying to explain that it was for his own good but he eventually hung up on me.

I was just trying to make this grieving process easier for him because I hated seeing him like that. Am I the asshole?

"AITA for making my son invite his school bully to his birthday party? My (41 M) son Aaron (11 M) had his birthday party recently, along with his twin sister (11 F). While sending out invites to everyone, Aaron told me that he doesn't want to invite Ben from his class because he's a ""bully"". He said he'd rather him not come at all.

I want to clarify that by ""bully"" it's nothing really physical. He apparently just makes fun of Aaron, tease him with girls' names, and once he even sent a girl in his class a letter by making it in Aaron's name. I know Ben's parents as we work together, and I also know the child. He's just mischievous and hasn't really touched Aaron physically. He just makes fun of him, etc.

I told him it's not a good thing to prevent him from arriving when others would be, but he strongly refused. He said I am trying to ruin his day. I told him that while it's his birthday and he should have fun, it's also important to not punish someone else just because they are mischievous. I explained that he had to be the better man, especially since Ben hasn't really done anything except from making fun of him, teasing him, and sending girls letters as people in that age-group do.

He got upset and asked Sarah (his twin sister) to back him up, and she was on his side. I didn't back down, however, and made him accept that Benjamin would be coming.

The party went just fine, Ben brought gifts, etc. Aaron wasn't happy he was there, but he managed to hold in his disappointment until everyone left. And then he began to yell at me, saying that he hates me and that he'd never talk to me.

I just didn't want to allow my son to throw a tantrum like that, again, Ben hasn't really done anything bad or bullied him in other ways.

She’s also been writing Fanfiction for that (don’t get me wrong I used to read fanfics as a teenager but I grew out of it).

And for what? So 5 people can watch them? And what’s the point of her writing those fanfics when there’s no one to read them.

She told me, and I quote, “it brings me joy.” And she wouldn’t even try to understand my point.

I'm severely allergic to animals. Dogs, cats, and horses.  Not anaphylaxis bad, but it's pretty severe.  Due to that, I avoid animals like the plague and purposely do not go to dog friendly places.  I can generally tell when a dog is near before I even see it.

Ten minutes later, I see a golden retriever (I think) wearing a service dog vest with its owner (20'sF)  and it sits 2 rows in front of me, a few seats over.  It lays down and appears well behaved.  But well behaved dogs are still an issue for me.  

I gently inquired if it was a service animal.  The owner just looks at me and glares at me for a second.  In my head, i'm just like ""Fuck"".

I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat.

Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then.

"AITA for standing my ground during a birthday dinner? I (50F) have a son who recently turned 18.

We were going out to celebrate his birthday with a family dinner with our family and his aunt and uncle. The night before, I asked him where he wanted to go, and he decided on an Indian restaurant we usually go to. Just to see if he wanted to switch it up or try something different because it's a special occasion, I suggested another Indian restaurant we went to once about 5 years ago and recently re-opened. He declined, saying that he didn't remember the restaurant and didn't know if the quality would still be the same 5 years later. I then suggested a new sushi restaurant that had caught my eye. He declined again because he didn't want to ""run the risk of having a bad restaurant for \[his\] birthday"". So we stayed with the normal Indian restaurant.

The next day, his aunt and uncle (my SIL and BIL) came over. They are very nice people and my son loves them a lot. I realized that they had already been to my son's chosen Indian restaurant twice already. I didn't want to bore our guests. So I brought up a new Greek restaurant that had also caught my eye, and asked my son to look at the menu. He looked through it rather quickly and declined. But then I remembered there was a new Italian restaurant that I wanted to do for my birthday but felt like my son would really like too. And when I asked him to look at that place's menu, he said okay.

When we arrived at the Italian restaurant that night, we noticed that a more fast-food pasta cafe had a location across the freeway. My BIL 'joked' that we could have gone there because it was cheaper. My son laughed, but I personally took offense to that. Dinner gets served, and the food was really good. However, the two cake slices for dessert came out rather small, as if they cut it in half and served it to us as if it were two slices. And sure enough, the bill included two desserts, not one. So I felt like we had been scammed.

We passed the same fast-food pasta cafe driving back home. My husband 'joked' about how my son chose a fishy restaurant that scammed us. My son says, ""Hey, this wasn't my choice."" But then my SIL follows up with a ""could've gone to the fast-food pasta place and they wouldn't have scammed us for $20"" 'joke'. My son, now laughing, says, ""Well maybe talk to the person who chose the restaurant."" He is being extremely disrespectful towards me. And all these 'jokes' are offensive. (Note my apostrophes.) It's well past 3 strikes, and I shout that next time I'll keep my f\*\*king mouth shut. I'm not going to stand being attacked like this since my son is an adult who can make his own decisions. 

When we arrived home, my son tried to apologize. I didn't want to hear it. Later on, he tries to ask me how my dinner was. This was a fake attempt to make me feel better and apologize again. So I calmly reminded him again that I didn't want to talk about the dinner. And that was it. I didn't want to be reminded of how I was attacked over a simple restaurant.

"AITA for sending a dish home with the guest who brought it Had some guests over the house yesterday. Specifically mentioned that we would have snacks and otherwise. Someone took it upon themselves to make a dip, completely unprompted, and bring it to the house. It was a nice gesture for sure, but as they were leaving I tried to give them their dish back so they could bring it home. They insisted on “getting it another time” even though they had a bag with them to carry said dish. I jokingly mentioned “so what, you bring a dish to my house and now I have to clean it for you? You’re basically bringing chores to my house!” (Channeling my inner Larry David). The guest then got incredibly pissed, called me rude, threatened to never bring anything over again, mentioning how they brought this out of kindness. 

Personally, if the dish had been forgotten then I wouldn’t have cared about cleaning it. But it wasn’t forgotten and they clearly refused to take it home when offering their dish back. AITA here?!",Asshole,1p9w06x
"AITA for asking my brother not to pay my daughter’s university tuition, as it was a deliberate consequence of her choices? My daughter will be attending university this fall, however, after much discussion she has chosen a school we disagree over. Initially I had preferred if I was to pay her full tuition that she would attend our local university and live at home. She convinced us to let her expand that search under the guise she was applying only to Catholic schools. When she was accepted into Georgetown University in Washington, DC, I was hesitant due to the 17 hour drive from Baton Rouge where we live… We were persuaded after a tour and because she was offered merit-based and needs-based scholarships which would cover nearly all of her tuition. Additionally, my brother and his spouse moved to Maryland near the DC area several months ago she would have family very nearby. 

Unbeknownst to myself and my husband, at the time she applied to other schools as well. She preferred to attend the University of Maryland. We told her if she expected us to provide any financial support then it would be to a Catholic university. We were also disappointed she would choose this school over Georgetown, which had been so kind to her, and also never having toured this other school. Knowing this, she still wanted to attend University of Maryland. We told her she is an adult and we cannot controll her, but she will learn there are long term consequences to adult choices, namely student loans. 

I since learned she had cried of this issue to my brother, who offered to pay for all of her tuition. He has no children of his own and he contributes nothing to the care of our elderly parents. I texted him and explicitly asked him not to do this because my daughter needs to learn she will not always be rescued. He not only told me it’s his money and he will do whatever he “damn well pleases” with it, but he also told me my lesson is “an absolute joke.” We got into a heated argument over this, and I told him I am concerned about his influence over my daughter as he has been an atheist for decades, among other issues, and my daughter looks up to him immensely… College is already a difficult time for faith… He told me I’m not helping that by “alienating her.” I tried to be civil and urged him to consider my plea to which he replied he “doesn’t need to consider it.” 

There is now considerable tension between us, and with my daughter. Am I in the wrong for wanting to help guide her into adulthood? ",Asshole,1dyps92
"AITA for laughing at my boyfriend for crying? My boyfriend came to my place yesterday evening. I could tell he was exhausted from work. We were about to watch a movie but he wanted to take a shower first. He came out a few minutes later and looked for something in his jacket.

He looked kinda distraught. I asked him what’s wrong and he started laughing while crying a bit. He said he bought a snickers and couldn’t find it but he wanted to eat it now. He looked everywhere but he didn’t find it and then he started breaking down a bit. And I know it sounds bad but I started laughing a bit because the situation seemed so bizarre to me. And I’ve NEVER seen him cry before. We’re dating for 10 months now and this was the first time I saw him crying which is insane. But I think that’s kinda the reason why I laughed a bit.

Anyway, he looked at me while I laughed a bit and his face kinda dropped. He put on his clothes and told me he’d go home now. I wanted him to stay because we wanted to watch a movie but he left anyway.

I tried texting him the whole night but he didn’t text back. I tried calling him but he doesn’t pick up. And I know that he has been online an hour ago. I feel like he’s mad at me or maybe he needs sometime for himself but I feel kinda bad for laughing.",Asshole,1agmgxi
"AITA for leaving the toilet seat up in a coed public restroom? My wife (F) and I (M) were out at a food truck lot with a brick &amp; mortar tap house. They have two bathrooms, both single use &amp; coed, which is very common where we live. I went to go pee and lifted the toilet seat up, then left it that way after I was done. She leaves to go pee as well once I’m back, and when she returns goes, “Which restroom did you use?”. Finding out it was the same one I just did, she tells me “Why’d you leave the seat up? My first thought when I walked in was, ‘what asshole left the seat up?!’

This started a debate between us, and I’m genuinely curious what you guys think. Keep in mind this is only for PUBLIC COED RESTROOMS. At home and in other peoples houses, yes the seat is always down and lid closed after I pee. 

My argument is that I’ve walked in to enough bathrooms where guys have peed all over the seat either drunk or just not caring, and don’t wipe it up; that it justifies potentially saving someone from sitting down in some else’s urine. I understand not wanting to touch the seat to lift it down, I use a piece of toilet paper so I don’t go bare hand to butt touching plastic to lift it up in the first place. I also think in a public coed restroom like that most sensible people would check before sitting down, so the accidentally falling in argument isn’t really there for me. 

My wife however says that women are less likely to check whether the toilet seat is left up or down, (especially if drinking). And never having to do their business with the toilet seat up, it shouldn’t be their responsibility to put the seat back down. As for peeing on the seat, she believes it’s men’s duty to raise the seat in the first place and clean any dribble if they left it. And that the majority of women who dribble know it’s their responsibility to clean it up. Also, statistically speaking it is more likely the next person will need the toilet seat down. 

(If you’re curious, yes, my wife looked over my shoulder while I wrote her argument to make sure they are her words). 


So, am I the asshole for leaving the seat up in a coed bathroom? 

*edit for context: I see a lot of comments saying it’s gross to flush with the lid not closed, these toilets don’t have a lid at all. Just a seat that can be raised or lowered. ",Asshole,1on3mp1
"AITA for embarrassing my brother I’m 23 and am visiting home. My younger brother is 17 and recently got a girlfriend. I met her at a family dinner at Applebees. Everyone was being polite and formal. At some point, someone asked how long they’d been dating, and she said it was pretty new but that he was “really mature for his age.""

I laughed a little because he is not mature and was acting all nonchalant for no reason. So I told a story I thought was funny and harmless. It was about how during lockdown, he got really into Among Us and once refused to leave a game and ended up peeing his pants. Like fully peed himself. He ran to the toilet with his iPad, and the pee trailed on the ground it was so freaking funny.

I felt bad though, because he got quiet so I apologized during dinner and tried to tell embarrassing stories about myself, like when I got rejected or sharting stories.

After dinner, he blew up at me. He said I embarrassed him on purpose, and now his girlfriend probably thinks he’s gross and immature. I told him everyone has a story like that, and I didn’t say it to be mean. It’s just a funny memory. He said I “always do this” and said I should’ve warned him or something. He hasn’t really talked to me since, and now my mom says that teenage boys are sensitive about their image, and that my follow up stories were gross.

"AITA For Not Letting my son go to sleepovers anymore? I (f48) have a 14yo son. I'm married to his dad (m52). 

My husband works 3-11, 5 days a week on different days each week. Because of that, hes not around when the kids are back from school, and is sleeping when the kids are getting ready for school. Even when he's not working that first day off is spent mostly in his room sleeping or watching TV.

Last weekend, my son asked to sleep over at a friends house, and i told him yes. I told him to tell his dad and it seemed he forgot. He eventually told his dad, but like the day before, which i wasnt happy about at all. The friend in question has divorced parents, one living in the town over, the other living about 30 mins away. My son at first told me he was sleeping over at the closer friends house, then i guess he was mistaken and he was going to sleepover at the farther away house. 

He didn't tell his dad about his ""mistake."" And when he came back from the sleepover, me and his dad were pretty upset with him for not being able to get things right, and his dad said no more sleepovers for the rest of the year. He can still come here though.

"AITA for agreeing with my sister's brother in law? So I don't know how to begin this, but I'll try to be understandable.
My sister, Delilah is 23F, her husband, Kenji is 25M. I am 27F, and I think her brother in law is 24M.

So to start my sister is really food sensitive if that's what you'd call it. She gets ""sick"" when she smells or eats certain foods, its been like this ever since she was 13. 

Just usually meals, condiments or snacks. For example: Ranch, eggs, chicken, bacon, beans, ketchup, mayo, mustard, maple syrup, and even cakes/cupcakes.
In my honest opinion I think she's faking, or at least exaggerating. She's not allergic to anything, not even pollen, and she doesn't have a medical diagnosis either. It just ""is how it is"" by her words.

So to the drama, we were all at dinner. Mostly our family and my sisters family. So it was a big dinner. We were cooking some of the food Delilah's ""sensitive"" to and she said she was going to go outside. By the way she doesn't make a fuss about it, she just tells someone where she's going, then comes back a bit later.

We all started eating, she came back at this time, and her brother in law started asking why she constantly went out the house tonight and every other event/family dinner. Delilah said it was nothing important and she wasn't feeling well. 
He continued to ""perster"" her until she told him she just didn't like how the food smelled. Let me mention that Delilah and my family don't speak English as our first language, and she has pretty bad grammar. 
Her brother in law took this as an insult and insulted her back a few times. Delilah ""apologized"" and said their food was wonderful and she didn't want to make it a big deal as it was. 

I said that I agree with brother in law and that she subtly wants attention, that she's been doing these ""food sensitivity"" thing for to long and it's frankly embarrassing for everyone and especially her husband.
She told me to have some respect since she's paying my rent. And obviously I told her back ""what the fuck??"" And why the hell she'd point that out in an attempt to embarrass me. 

She stayed quiet and didn't really talk to me or my brother in law, when we tried talking to her she ignored us. But did not do that to anyone else.

She told me a while back her husband has no issue with it and he's fine. Again, in my honest opinion she's forcing her husband to go on this weird ass diet so she can stay skinny or something.  I say that because she never really developed, I mean she was less than 120 pounds her entire childhood and teenhood. And alot of people including myself commented on it. 

So she's probably trying to stay that way. Her husband told me to chill out after the dinner, not sure what he told brother in law.

But my rent is due soon and my sister still hasn't been talking to me. Our parents don't really care about it, and say I should've been more respectful to the person paying me each month.

"AITA for saying I didn’t like my birthday gift and losing 5 friends because of it? For some background I (17 F) was diagnosed with autism and ADHD back in elementary school. My special interest is Bakugo from my hero academia, and has been for around five years straight. He’s my entire personality and I acknowledge that people have told me I even talk too much about him, but I can always stop if people tell me they want to talk about something else. 

My  former friend, Violet,  (17 F) was also autistic too, and she loved anime and my hero academia and since we had several same classes together, we would consistently talk about our interests. I really valued our friendship because she was one of the only friends who had the same intense energy as me. 

My birthday was coming up, but I was planning to throw a small party with all my close friends and then a bigger party later so I told them if they wanted to bring something small, they could, but it definitely wasn’t required.
A few days later, Violet surprised me with a gift. since she knew all about my Bakugo obsession, especially because we talk about it so frequently, I thought it would be related to him. I opened it up…and it was a Hello Kitty figure. of course I didn’t show any disappointment. I smiled, thanked her, and acted excited.
Inside though, I was kind of hurt. I don’t even remember mentioning Hello Kitty, and she knew Bakugo was my special interest. 

What made it sting even more was that one of Violet’s friend who also likes Bakugo (Who I don’t really get the opportunity to speak to as we don’t have any classes) was given a Bakugo plushie. My best friend, Ellie, asked later if I was disappointed that it wasn’t Bakugo related and I confessed that I was a little bit surprised, and disappointed, but I repeatedly expressed that I was grateful and I still decently like hello Kitty.

Well, apparently a few days later, Ellie tells Violet and one night I get a long text detailing how Violet will be ending my friendship with me because I showed several red flags. I was only interested in talking about my interest and she felt like all I did was talk about myself and she knew that I was ungrateful about the gift. 
Which to be fair is true I do primarily like to talk about my interest, but I would’ve been happy to listen to her and talk about her interests which we did in the classes, but she never expressed this frustration towards me. 

After this things completely spiraled one after another, I lost friends and eventually, I lost five friends in total because of this event. Honestly, I am still confused. I’m confused if maybe I was an asshole. And my love language is primarily gift-giving and honestly even if it was cheap and lame if it was Bakugo related or handmade I would’ve loved it.

So- AITA for being honest about feeling disappointed in a gift? 

Edit: I hope providing these last messages gives some form of context. 

This is from Violet- Hey (my name), I don't want to be friends anymore. Recently our friendship has been toxic with the way you've been treating me. you never ask about me and every time we talk it's about you and your interests. I know how you feel about the gift. You're allowed to not like my gift bc thats just how you feel and you cant control that however, you become ungrateful once you start telling people about it and saying that I don't know you and that I don't appreciate you or our friendship. (which I never said!!!) 
I really hope you don't take this as hate and use this as an opportunity to reflect on yourself and your actions. I don't hate you. I just cannot be in this friendship when I'm noticing this many red flags. I hope you understand where I'm coming from and know that I'm not coming from a place of hatred or resentment.

And this was Hannah’s- if you have to explain your actions so in depth after someone, aka i, confronts you about it, then i do not want to continue this friendship with you. you are immature and so materialistic that it impedes on your personal life and friendships to the point that this relationship is not fulfilling anymore. i shouldve ended this early when you treated Violet so disrespectfully, so suck a luxury brand dick and stay obsessed with your crazy ass parasocial insane ""relationship"" with bakugo.

"AITAH for telling my fiancé's friends that we aren't friends and to leave me alone TL:DR I yelled at my girlfriends friends that we'll never be friends and to leave me alone

So on December 1st my Fiancé's friend, (I don't know which one) hosted a holiday get together, that I immediately did not want go to but kept it to myself because I know how much my fiancé loves her girlfriends. I do not have a problem with her girlfriends, its their partners that piss me off.

For background, each of them have tried to connect with me or befriend me over the years, and each time I've shot them down as bluntly as possible. I have my own group of friends and I don't want more. I smile and keep everything surface level in person because I know my fiancé loves get togethers.

On the first night we all met, we all exchanged numbers. And once they each tried to text me or call me I blocked them. They added me on snapchat and added me to their groupchat, I again blocked all of them and left the groupchat. They added me to a groupchat on Instagram, again blocked them all and left the groupchat. Twitter/X, blocked.  Facebook, blocked. Emails, blocked. Even here on reddit, they're all blocked. They invite me to their ""boys nights"" through my fiancé, stern ""fuck no"" every time.

So at the get together the 8 of us (me + 7 partners) are sat in the living room while the ladies cooked and talked.  They were in there own conversation about the election and football and whatever and I was just smiling and nodding. One of them makes a joke about me being quiet, I try an laugh it off but he kept pressing it so I left and hid in the bathroom until the food was ready.

During the dinner the partners kept digging into me as usual trying to get me to open up, asking me about my work and hobbies and my proposal story and wedding plans. I gave the the same surface level answers as always but for some reason they weren't having it, and then everyone except my fiancé started yelling at me for some reason saying that I'm such a ""prick"" and ""what's wrong with me"" and that I act like ""I'm better than them"".

So I obviously yelled back at them, the SparkNotes version is:

I don't know them, and don't want to get to know them, Leave me the F alone, I don't know any of your names, I don't care to know your names. Friends-in-law isn't a thing and that just because our partners are friends doesn't make us friends. \*Using my forearm to make a line\* This is the line, stop trying to cross the line, stop approaching the line, back the f away from the line. Everyone stay arms lengths away from me.

Then I threw the car keys on the table and took a Lyft home. When my fiancé came home the following morning she looked like she had been crying. I've never seen my fiancé so angry or disappointed and sad. I tried apologizing to her but she called her dad to help get her stuff from our place, and I have no clue where she's staying. My calls go to voicemail, my text are on delivered. AITAH?

"AITA for being upset over my brother's relationship? So I (22M) have a brother (24M) who's been seeing this girl for around six or seven months now. If it's relevant, my brother works 40 hour weeks, Monday to Friday, and works overtime quite frequently. He's a workaholic, if you will. On the other hand I'm unemployed and have been for a year now, I have my degree and diploma but am still job searching. 

My brother and I were born 19 months apart, so as you can imagine, we've always been very close. We always have done everything together, and still pretty much do. We have many shared interests. Golf, soccer, you name it. Except, now that he's in a relationship, a lot of the time we spend together has significantly decreased. 

Him and his gf are long distance, so they can only see each other on weekends, and even then, it's an hour and a half trip one way, and he always seems to be the one going up to see her. So pretty much every weekend he's not home, unless either of them have other plans. He's also wasting a lot of his gas, because his workplace is already over a half hour drive from our place, and to go up to her place is even further. 

Another thing I should mention is that she's a bit on the heavy side. I genuinely just don't find her attractive at all, I don't know what he could possibly see in her. She also has tattoos, which my dad does not approve of. He hasn't seen them yet, though, because she very strategically wears long sleeve shirts when she sees my parents, which has only been twice now. 

We met her over dinner several months ago, and I guess I must've been visibly offput, because my mom said after the fact that I was being very rude towards her. I didn't actually say anything to her, though, but I guess I looked really disengaged. 

Although I was still annoyed about my brother being away every weekend, the straw that broke the camel's back was the weekend that he missed a soccer match we have with our friends, which is a weekly event during the summer, to go to a function with her family. 

Though my mom pointed out that other friends of ours have missed games, too, I reminded her that the summer is almost over and so we would only have a few more games to play. On top of that, we film each game, so I had to go even earlier to set everything up by myself. I don't think it's right for him to ditch his friends and our weekly games over his girlfriend who he sees every single weekend otherwise. 

Now, we're going to a get together at our aunt's house for our cousin, and my mom told my brother to invite his gf, which he did, so now she'll be meeting one side of our family. 

Obviously I'm not happy about this at all, but our younger sister (18F) and our mom and dad are both fine with it, and are constantly telling me to ""get over it"" and accept that he's a grown adult who wants to settle down. I just don't think this relationship will last, and he's wasting his time. AITA?

**EDIT** 

Okay, so since I mentioned her appearance, a lot of people are focusing on that. Okay, fair enough, but let me add a bit of context as to why that bothers me so much. When my brother was younger, like early adolescent age, he'd make fun of fat people. My sister used to be on the heavier side before she reached her full height, and he would tease and pick on her for that. He doesn't anymore obviously, but he did. So I guess hypocrisy comes into play as well in my annoyance with the relationship. 

Also - it's not even just her appearance. She's quite irritating. She finds everything he says funny for some reason.

**EDIT 2**

So the overwhelming majority consensus is that I'm a major AH, apparently. I feel like, again, everybody is focusing too much on the appearance part of it and not as much on what I'm saying. Why is it only MY responsibility to get along with my brother's gf?? Should she not have to make an effort too?? I said after that she should've tried to make conversation that night we met her, but my sister said she probably felt uncomfortable to even try because of the ""look on my face."" 

And again, I'll add - they're also on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At least, I thought my brother was, unless she's caused him to change sides or whatever. I thought nowadays difference in political parties was a bone of contention in relationships. So there's that too.",Asshole,1628y15
"AITA for being a “deadbeat” parent to my older son? Some background - my ex had been fighting for custody since 2020 and is still going. He finally managed to get my older son living with him and because the courts kept my younger son with me we now only see the other child every other weekend so the boys can spend weekends together. I filed for child support but because we make around the same, it was set at 0 with us splitting medical costs and him covering insurance.

So before when both kids lived with me primarily I paid for everything for them - medical, extracurriculars, etc.  my ex paid my rent and phone bill and paid for stuff for the kids separate from me. He however decided he didn’t owe any support anymore when the custody became 50/50 even though its his job as a father to support his family. 

Now that my older son is with him he constantly hounds me for money that I can’t afford because I work part time now and have a baby with my new partner to take care of. I also pay for my younger son (clothes, food, haircuts, school supplies, doctors visits) and never ask him for anything for him.  He feels that because he still pays on his own decision for clothing and shoes for my younger son that I am a “deadbeat” for not providing for my older son (I do still pay for half my older son’s braces which is like 100/month and for birthday/xmas gifts and got him a backpack for school).

Some things my ex keeps asking for:

- half of my son’s contact lens fees
- half of copays for medical procedures 
- money for his extracurriculars which are OPTIONAL and cost way too much
- half of school field trip fees

I keep telling him I don’t have the money and now he is heavily implying I don’t care about my older son and that my older son is way more expensive than my younger son so me not contributing to his expenses is basically “deadbeat” status.  The most hurtful thing he has said is that my kids stepmom provides more for my older son than I do because I won’t “step up” which is terrible and unfair because she makes way more money as it is.

"AITA For Telling my Husband It's ""Just A Car"" After I Accidentally Totaled It? A couple days I was driving to see some friends while my husband was at work. I will admit, I don't always go exactly the speed limit, sometimes 5-10 over.

"AITA for kicking a girl out of a support group? I (F20) am in college. In high school, my friends and I were considered the ""weird kids"" because we don't party, drink, or go out. To provide background information, we were bullied a lot and I have developed anxiety as a result. A lot of my friends in college have similar backgrounds, but it's much better now because the more ""social"" personalities that would have bullied us in HS leave us alone for the most part, so I am doing well now and am in mental health recovery.

Anyway, with finals coming up and spring social events being in full swing, my friends and I decided to start a student support group for fellow students with anxiety. We advertised it on social media and held it in a classroom this morning. At first, it was going fine. My friends and I were very comfortable because the room was full of people like us and everyone could hear and relate to each other, so talking about how we were doing was very therapeutic. However, about 10 minutes in, a girl walked in that I recognized from one of my classes.

This girl, to put it gently, is nothing like us. She is incredibly social and is involved in things like greek life and admissions, and there is no doubt in my mind that if we had gone to high school together, she would have at least been friends with my tormentors. At first, we thought she was looking for a sorority event or something, so we told her that this was the anxiety support group. She said she knew and was here for that.

I immediately pointed out that she clearly has no trouble putting herself out there, and I voiced my doubts that she knew what real anxiety felt like. She said that she's been having a tough time with finals and was hoping to talk to people that understood. I sympathized with this-- of course anyone can get anxious from schoolwork, but it wouldn't be fair to have her there around people that have been struggling with social anxiety for their whole lives and wanted to talk to similar personalities about our shared experiences.

I told her as much, and that maybe the guidance offices could help with her schoolwork, but that having someone there that couldn't relate to social anxiety and resembled people that only make this issue worse can make the space less comfortable for people to be open in, and that I wanted everyone to be able to be open and to relate to each other. She apologized and left.

One of the other attendees said that what I had done was horrible and that I had no right to suggest that she wasn't anxious. That wasn't what I was suggesting at all; merely that it can be harder for other people to share their true feelings in the presence of someone who can't understand, but I do understand how it could have come across that way.

AITA?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I believe some of you missed my point-- I'm not saying she can't feel anxious because she is popular, I was saying that her presence could be triggering for other members of the group. That said, she wasn't in class this morning so I wasn't able to apologize for the miscommunication in person, and to be honest I don't know if I would have been able to without fear of being ridiculed again. After talking to my therapist, we agreed that I wouldn't be able to seek her out and apologize personally for the above reason, but I still wanted to make sure she knew that I wasn't trying to downplay her anxious thoughts. I reached out to the guidance office to let them know that she was stressed about finals so hopefully they will help her manage that. I also let her sorority know that she had come to my group via their social media DMs. Idk how good a bunch of sorority girls will be at helping her manage her anxious thoughts (LOL), but she chose to join and hopefully they'll know her mind well enough to help. After all, she has many friends that should be able to support her.

EDIT2: Wow, a ton of you continue to miss my point. First, for anyone insinuating that she doesn't feel welcome at her sorority due to her anxiety and was trying to make friends with us instead or that maybe she felt unsafe with her sorority friends knowing about it, she is constantly talking about how welcomed and close she feels with them, so I figured they would be a good support system for her. I really do think they'll care about her mental health and want to support her. Again, they're not the brightest, so whether they'll actually be able to do that remains to be seen, but those are her friends and they can support her. Second, why would a person be embarrassed about having anxiety? If people were going to be unsupportive that would be one thing, but as we've already established, she has people that will at least attempt to give her the support she needs. Anxiety isn't something you need to be ashamed of and hide from the people you care about. I hope she sees that now. But yes, I was TA for kicking her out so abruptly. ",Asshole,12xu5gh
"AITA for telling my boyfriend to go to a therapist because of his Friday the 13th ‘obsession’? So my boyfriend and I are dating for only six months now but I reaaallyyy love him. He’s physically a 10 and personality wise also. However he has a very strange obsession with the Friday the 13th movies and Jason Voorhees.

I’m not kidding. He watches the movies at least once every weekend, he got countless pics of Jason in his camera roll, he named his dog Jason, he got Jason figures, you name it

At first I thought it’s fun and kinda cute but now I feel like it’s waaayyy over the point of that. Almost everyday he shows me some edits of Jason and I can tell that he’s really ‘passionate’ about this stuff. It’s like that’s his whole personality.

I tried talking to him about it today but it didn’t go well. He told me that the franchise comforts him and that he loves Jason, that he always watched it when he was a kid since he got bullied in school.

I advised him to go to a therapist because of it, as I don’t think it’s healthy to be this obsessed with a movie franchise and a fictional character (especially cause he’s a murderer). He got very emotional then, his eyes got red (I’ve never seen him like this before) and said that he’s disappointed that I don’t understand him. His reaction wasn’t that bad but he was clearly upset.

I kinda feel bad for it since these movies and Jason bring him so much joy but I just don’t see how that’s healthy.",Asshole,1e8vzri
"AITA for telling a friend I excluded her because of her fitness level? I 27F just got engaged to the love of my life. I have a group of four bridesmaids, all of whom are in late 20s. This story specifically concerns one bridesmaid who I'll call Ellie.

For bachelorette-type events I am doing two things. One is in my town for dress fittings, spa treatments, followed by a night out, and a brunch the next day. The other is a 2-day Disney trip. I invited all the bridesmaids except Ellie to Disney and said it was because we all know she has limited paid time off and I want to prioritize the day in town because it's more special to have us all be able to really spend time together.

This was not entirely true. While she has limited PTO, that wasn't the reason why she wasn't invited. Honestly, she's a big girl. I'd estimate upwards of 250lbs. This doesn't matter, she's gorgeous and I love her, but it does affect her ability to participate in anything with even moderate physical activity. For example, last year, we had walked about 1/2 a mile to a restaurant in 75 degree weather and she was out of breath within about 2 minutes and needed to recover in the AC for a solid 10 minutes after we got to the restaurant before Ellie was really able to engage in the conversation. Another time, we went on a ""hike"" in the park which was a flat 1/3 mile loop and I had to pretend that I needed a break because it was obvious she was struggling and I didn't want her to feel embarrassed for needing a break. I'm also somewhat worried that she wouldn't be able to fit in some of the rides.

I really, really don't want to be mean and exclude her but I also know what's going to happen if she comes. She's going to be exhausted and need to sit down or find AC. We're going to feel bad and hang out with her so she doesn't get left behind. Ellie would of course never ask us to wait for her or anything but that's what friends do.

A few days ago, Ellie called me and said she was hurt to not be invited and that she would take unpaid time off to join. I tried to say we had already booked the hotel, she said she would find accommodations. When she asked for a third time, I finally told her that we're going to be doing a lot of walking and I wasn't sure if she could keep up. I don't want her to feel embarrassed or unwelcome, but her weight makes it hard for her to enjoy herself and it brings the mood down. I didn't specifically say anything about weight but she immediately took it as me calling her fat. I mean, I kind of was. I support her existing in any shape or size, but some shapes and sizes make activities a lot harder.

"AITA for refusing to inform my roommate when I’m inviting people over? My roommate has social anxiety. I don’t really believe in that because everyone is anxious at some point, not need to make it out like it’s something special. But that’s besides the point, since I’m not the one here to judge. Anyway, because of that, if I have company over they tend to stay hidden up in their room unless they need to eat or use the bathroom. Well this has been becoming more and more a problem since everyone has been getting vaccinated. I’m having a lot of small parties (5-10 friends over) while I have the chance. I haven’t seen my friends in a very long time so I think I’m more than justified. So my roommate has been begging me to give her even a days heads up if I’m planning on having more of these get togethers. Because apparently they are “severely mentally unprepared” and end up having a borderline anxiety attack trying to get something to eat just because there are multiple strangers occupying the kitchen/living area. I  refuse to because 1: it’s not my fault and not my problem and 2: it’s their problem they have anxiety and at the age they are now (22) it’s absolutely insane to me that they haven’t found a way to get over it.

"AITA for not going to my boyfriends granddads funeral because my bf didn't wear underwear? My (23F) boyfriend (27M) of 4 years doesn't wear underwear ever and hasn't since he was a kid. He doesn't even own any underwear. He thinks underwear is uncomfortable and restrictive. At the beginning of our relationship I encouraged him to try different styles and cuts and sizes of underwear but he was very adamant that he'd tried all the types of underwear and it just isn't for him. It hasn't really been an issue in our relationship. I was worried he'd smell bad because of it but he's actually a pretty clean guy and washes his clothes regularly and stuff. 

Recently my bfs granddad died and my bf was obviously distraught. I was very supportive but on the day of the funeral he got dressed like normal (no underwear) and when I told him I wasn't going unless he wore underwear he thought I was joking and told me that I harping on about nonsense to a grieving man. He reminded me he didn't have any underwear (we were a 2 min walk from a primark and I offered to grab some for him, also we were staying with his parents and 2 brothers so he could've borrowed a pair off them). But I told him it was disrespectful to not wear any underwear to a funeral. He said it was fine because it is his own suit and not a rented suit and no one will be looking at his crotch but it made me uncomfortable so I didn't go. 

When he got back he was pissed off at me and gave me the silent treatment. His parents were angry at me too and told me that it was such an inappropriate thing to think about at his granddads funeral (they also don't believe he doesn't wear underwear) and that I let down my bf when it mattered most.

It's been a week and I'm back at our place while my bf is still with his parents. I'm feeling a bit guilty about all this but AITA?

"WIBTA for disobeying and still expecting to see my girlfriend? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. I realized I did not explain my story very well, so I’m here to make it more cohesive.

I am a 15-year-old, non-binary person. I use they/it pronouns.
I have a girlfriend (she/her), we are long distance. It’s a 19-hour walk.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have several mental health issues, namely; insomnia and photophobia.

I cannot sleep at night. I pass out when I don’t get enough sleep because I am a human being that could die from not sleeping. I also have an increased sensitivity to light, which can result in pain or avoidance. Light, of any kind, sun, bright light, dim light, any color of light- tends to hurt my head and eyes. This information isn’t the key detail of my story, it’s only here to explain why I don’t go on walks during the day and why I’ve been missing those walks.

As well as being burnt-out. “Burnout isn't just for adults. In fact, teens can get super overwhelmed with all of their life responsibilities and get burnt out too. High school, sports, extracurricular activities, friends, romantic relationships, social media, and family can all cause stress for teens.”, since you can’t wrap your head around that for some reason. Yes, I’m a teenager, and I can also be burnt-out.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What my day normally looks like:

I wake up (or already are awake because I didn’t sleep).
I wait for my girlfriend to get back from school, I call her.
When 6-7, around the time my mom gets home, sometimes later, hits- I go on a walk.
Then I come back at around 7-9.
End day.

I do not talk to anyone besides my girlfriend. On Friday’s I have therapy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearing up some things before I get to the story!

I happened to, near the time of the story, see a doctor. However, I don’t normally see doctors. Like, rarely ever. I barely told anything to my doctor. I just said to my doctor, word for word, “I go on walks, but I have been missing them recently”.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The story itself: I woke up at 9:46. I saw the time. I start to feel very stressed and an extreme need to get out of the house. I have thought about asking my mom to wake me up if I’m sleeping before, but considering that she might respond in an unpleasant way, I felt uncomfortable approaching her with this issue. I thought about asking her if I could leave instead of just doing it, but considering how badly I needed to leave. If I got a ‘no’, I’d feel even worse. The reason why I’ve been passing out is because I haven’t been sleeping lately. I couldn’t stand being in the house. So I left. I didn’t sneak out. I made no attempt to hide what I was doing, I was scared to do what I was doing but it was a moment of weakness/impulse. Something I couldn’t control, in the moment, and I know I probably should’ve talked with my mom but I didn’t wanna just mindlessly be blamed or have to get into an argument. That’s why I think, yes, I deserve a punishment. Just not one that would be literally..

#1. Completely unrelated to the incident.
#2. Be my mom punishing my girlfriend for something I did.
#3. Be so harsh considering I was having mental struggles she had been ignoring lately, despite me sharing how I felt, and her not at all communicating things with me.

Before there’s any more confusion, I didn’t ask her to wake me up, or ask her if I could leave. But I did share how much the walks meant to me, expressed how I’ve been feeling lately, etc. and all that was completely ignored.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The point of the story: I believe the punishment was not fit, considering the story said.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some history with/things about my mom:

In the past I have gone on walks past 10:00. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have ran away from home. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have been sexually abused/assaulted. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have been physically abused. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have been emotionally/mentally/verbally abused. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have said I wanted to die. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have self-harmed. She has known, and not cared.
In the past I have attempted suicide. She has known, and not cared.

She is on and off with her parenting. She doesn’t get to just decide to ‘care’ now.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit/Note:  I do not have a job, a car, or money. My mom does. She is my parent, I know that, she is in charge of my safety. She can be doing the bare minimum so that she doesn’t get in trouble for not taking care of me.

AITA for letting my 3 year old watch my phone while she poops? Parents: my 3 year old daughter is often constipated so when she poops I’m very excited. Sometimes I give her my phone to watch something while she’s pooping so she can be comfortable while pooping and not keep holding it in. My wife HATES this and thinks it’s the worst thing in the world. Sometimes I just want things to be easier. I know it’s prob not the right thing to do but in the grand scheme of things it’s not so bad. As soon as my daughter’s done pooping I take the phone away and she’s totally fine. My wife starts a fight with me about it every single time. I don’t think it’s THAT big of a deal. We watch TV all the time so it’s not like we don’t have screen time in our house.

"AITA for telling my sister she's ridiculous for not inviting me to her wedding over a kiss from almost 10 years ago ? My (30F) sister (28F) had an almost non-existent relationship for almost a decade cause when she was 19 I kissed her at the time on and off boyfriend. They were high school sweethearts but they were fighting all the time and broke up already multiple times before the kiss incident (tho the kiss caused their permanent). I know it was very wrong of me to do that but during that time my dating life was a mess and I ended bonding with my sister's bf whom was also going through a rough relationship with her and we ended bonding and developing feelings for each other. 

However I haven't slept with him while he was dating my sister, it was only a kiss to which he immediately confessed to, but since then she essentially blacklisted both of us, but especially me. I guess the guy didn't remain in our lives for so long cause I dumped him as well after an year of dating after losing the spark, but my sister kept up the name calling and the slut shaming me for years and even after countless apologies from me, she still hasn't forgiven me.

I just found from my mom that my sister's getting married and that she hasn't given me an invitation to her wedding and when I confronted my sister about it she literally said that I don't deserve one. I told her that she's ridiculous and immature for still keeping a grudge for a mistake from almost 10 years ago and she just told me to go to hell. I tried contacting her fiance to explain my side of things to him cause I'm sure my sister overreacting the gravity of the situation to him, but my sister somehow found out and now she deluded herself into thinking that I want to ""steal"" her husband as well and now I hear she even wants to hire security from preventing me from attending (not that I wouldn't come if I wasn't invited).

"AITA for giving my girlfriend the silent treatment because she killed a bug? I was hanging out with my girlfriend in my room yesterday. She said she saw a fly crawling around on my desk and asked me to kill it. I don’t like killing bugs, so I said I’d just open a window and shoo it out.

Before I could do so, my mom called me downstairs for something, so I told her I’d be back and not to kill the fly.

I was back 5 minutes later, and my girlfriend informed me she had crushed the fly and laughed.

"AITA for asking my daughter if she wants to rent my house after kicking her out 
I (42M) am moving 9 hours away in another state from my kids: (19F) (17F) (15F) (13M) to live with my girlfriend. Their mother passed 6 years ago so it is just me. The easiest way I thought I should do this since no one wants to go (but if it works out better that I have to bring the minors with me then they will just have to come) is that I offered to my 19 year old to rent my house with her girlfriend, they would live with the other three kids and they also have their cats. I'd pay for everything else, because it is still my house and I still have to come here for work so my thought was crashing on the couch or something since it is still my place and the plan is to sell it. I wanted to ease everyone into the process of me moving and not have to involve other family to take in my kids. 

My oldest has voiced some concerns that I just don't understand. Her biggest one was that since I kicked her out to light a fire under her to get out and live on her own and enjoy freedom, she feels like now that I'm asking her to come back and pay rent and live here again that it contradicts why I kicked her out. 

To me this is totally different. Another thing was that she and her gf (who lived here to for over a year) thought it would be hard moving back in loving with everyone again including me part time, because of how “horrible” it was and ""toxic"" it was and how they don't want to go back to a “dark place”. 

She added how the house is in rough shape, lots fo broken things that’ I’ll eventually fix, front door lock is broken, and some water damage issues, and also appearance problems. I said we could paint whatever, i'll be their maitence guy, because it is still my house, but it seems that she doesn't like the thought of me having ""control"" over her which i don't understand. i've always been told i guilt people for supplying roofs over their heads, heat, etc when i simply want respect for what I do for them. Her idea was more so that she finds her own place and she did she'd take on my two youngest instead of maintaining a house, all 3 kids, our dog and her cats, cleaning, parenting etc. But to me it's a better deal financially and logistically for us all? And it doesn't feel right to have her take them on because then I'd have to sign a legal guardianship. 

She also says how everyone just wants this over with, just sell the house and I leave so they can start to heal. I have many reasons why selling would be more complicated right now, ans juat keeping them all in the same house while I'm gone and then crashing when I work for now just seems best for me financially and then like I said so no other family members have to take any of my kids in if I let them stay.

"AITA for not wanting my MIL to be paid to look after my children? Two months ago, I went back to full-time work. My MIL, who already provided a lot of childcare for my husband and I, became are youngest two children's (4M, 1F) main weekday caregiver. She watches them from around 8am till 6pm. She also picks up our oldest two children (7M, 6M) from school and my two stepsons (16M, 14M) spend a lot of time at her house. She has a similar arrangement with her daughter and her two children (7M, 3F).  
  
Previously, my kids already spent a lot of time at her house and my husband would often slip her some money to cover things like food costs. The kids have always really liked it her at their grandma's house. She still has her two youngest children living at home (16F, 13M), as well as her niece and her niece's son (5M).  
  
I recently found out that my husband has talked to his mom (without telling me) about paying her to watch our children. The amount he wants to pay her would be around $80 a day and it would be out of his bank account.  
  
I am against this for several reasons. Firstly, he didn't even discuss it with me before talking to her about it. Secondly, I think it's turning a family obligation to help one another out into a financial one. Thirdly, it will continue to incentivise her to not get an actual job (she's been unemployed for 4 years). Fourthly, one of her brothers is already bankrolling her and bought the house she lives in, I'm not even sure she pays any of her household bills, I don't want my husband and I to be the next chumps paying her bills. Lastly, she hasn't even shown any interest in us paying her, it was my husband who brought it up, I worry he's going to cause problems where they don't need to be any.  
  
When I brought up not wanting us to pay her to my husband we got into an argument, and he thinks I'm being an asshole about it. His argument is she is essentially providing the service of a nanny and therefor deserves to get paid for it and as we can afford to pay her for it we should. He also thinks she's likely to use the money to buy more toys and crafty type things for the kids.  
  
I think if you start paying a family member for childcare where do you draw the line. I used to watch MIL's youngest kids all the time when I was on maternity leave and she was working, arguably I should send her an invoice. And like I said her brother already helps her out financially, so she doesn't exactly need the money. Am I the asshole here or am I making some fair points?",Asshole,18aru17
"AITA 59F for speaking to my son 37M individually and telling him I’m concerned about some of his wife’s behaviors? I’m a 59F and I have a son 37M and their daughter my granddaughter who is 4 years old we will call her Maeve, another son 36F, and a daughter 35 F my son is married to my DIL we will call her Sara 35F. My son and Sara have been married 5 years and dated for 9 before that. They are each other’s first relationships. Growing up my son was always a little different and kind of a loner but had a huge gentle heart. My son is head over heels in love with his wife and will do anything for her. I can tell she really loves him too. 

Every year on my son’s birthday I get him a gift and I text my DIL I also get my son a Father’s Day gift bc I am proud of my son being a father and I want to show him some love. Recently I planned a family vacation with my husband and children and bc I don’t have a lot of money I told my son I can afford to pay for him but not his wife. Well recently my son came to me and said his wife is very upset that she is never acknowledged on her bday, Mother’s Day, and that I said I will pay for his portion of the vacation but not her portion. 

He said he will no longer accept gifts from me if I don’t include his wife. She has a bit of a strong personality and like I said earlier my son would do anything for his wife since she was the first person besides me as his mother and his father  of course to really appreciate him for who he is. Him and his brother are complete opposites so they were never close. 

Whenever my son visits me his wife ALWAYS comes and if I ever ask my son to have some one on one mother son time his wife gets highly offended. My son seems happy however I can’t help but my DIL is emotionally abusing my son by isolating him from his family by basically gaslighting my son into thinking somehow he is being disloyal to her by accepting a gift from his own mother and her coming along to every single hangout. I mean my gosh he already gives his wife the world and his attention 98% of the time god forbid he has something that’s between him and his mother. 

His wife spoke to me about it as well and said now that we are married she feels that she should be acknowledged on Mother’s Day, her birthday, and vacations if her husband is. When I explained he is my son and my relationship with him will always be a little different and sometimes I want to do things individually for him and while I care about her a lot as my DIL it will water down my relationship with my son if I treat them exactly the same every time I do something for my son. 

AITA for speaking to my son individually and telling him I’m concerned about some of his wife’s behaviors and this could make me the AH because instead of caring that my DIL’s feelings are hurt I’m doubling down on saying some of her behaviors towards my son are abusive.

"AITA for telling my friend why she can't find a partner? I (22f) was having lunch with my friend yesterday (21f). She has trouble with finding a partner so I had set her up on a date with an aquaintance of mine the day before, so I asked her how it went. She said it went alright, but they just didn't really connect. This suprised me a bit, since I set them up together because they have a lot of shared interests. I asked her what she didn't like about him, and she tried to avoid the question but after I continued asking about it she responded that he had straight up told her he found her physically unattractive. 

She seemed a bit sad about it but it didn't suprise me at all. She is pretty flat chested and instead of dressing in a way that flatters her she wears clothing that looks EXTREMELY unappealing on her because it draws attention to her lack of a chest (think things like dresses, wool sweaters, sleeveless turtleneck tops).

I told her that she would probably have an easier time on her next date if she embraced her body type and dressed more appropriately. I meant that as a confidence boost as in a ""be happy with your body!"" type way but she seemed pretty peeved and asked with what I meant with dressing more appropriately. I explained that her style draws attention to her lack of a chest so she should try to dress more like a tomboy instead of trying to look feminine. This seemed to annoy her even more somehow and she said that her tits don't define her femininity, and that her clothes don't even draw attention to them.

"AITA for giving my girlfriend therapy for christmas? I (M32) got my girlfriend (F29) six sessions of therapy for her birthday+christmas present this year (her bday is Dec 16). I couldn't book the appointments myself since it's not my insurance and she is not my dependent obviously, so I gave her a nice card and inside said I would pay for the amount for six sessions of therapy based on the rates in my area. I spent a lot of time researching providers that matched her health insurance and settled on a general budget that is absolutely up for negotiation based on what provider she ends up liking.

We got into an argument when I gave it to her and she is staying with a friend, which she has never done before (she's been living in my apt for 5 months). She screamed and cried asking if I thought she was crazy or if I was unhappy, which is not the case at all! She is an amazing woman, has been getting increasingly emotional over small things and has talked about wanting to consider therapy. I think she would benefit from it because she is under a lot of stress from her job, has had some bad relationships in the past, and over the last few months has gotten increasingly irritable no matter what I do to fix things. I was trying to be thoughtful since therapy is something I wouldn't want to pay for myself since it isn't a ""fun"" purchase. We have been together for over a year and I thought that is what partners do for each other.

She told the friend she's staying with (F29 or something) that I think she's crazy (which is not true!). I am just not a trained professional and when she complains about work and things I can't change, I don't know what she wants from me. I can't fix her problems because I am not doing them to her. And they are the same problems over and over, I can't keep track of all the details and developments anymore. It is frustrating hearing about the same old things. I can't fix her shitty coworkers or her bad budgeting since I have never been in those situations, so I wanted to set her up with someone who knows what to do.

Also, for the record, I got her another gift she could unwrap on Christmas day and an additional one she could unwrap in front of her family that is very nice/expensive, but she hasn't opened that yet and doesn't know what I got her (it is expensive jewelry).

AITA for trying to genuinely help my girlfriend?

"AITA for accusing my (M35) partner (F35) of faking her symptoms? Background: Dating for 1.5 years, living together, no kids.

About a year ago, my partner broke down hard in acute stress-related burnout, and was on 100% sick leave for 6-8 months. She could barely leave the house due to fatigue, dizziness and balance problems. She also had an MRI to rule out neurological issues.

She is on the road to recovery and is now working again. However, she is still not well. She seems to sometimes get overwhelmed by stimuli when we are out, and she gets spells of dizziness where she basically just collapses/falls down. She’ll sometimes tell me that she’s not feeling well, and say that she’d appreciate some kindness/sympathy (she has said that I’m not very good at expressing this). I think she expects more sympathy from me, but for some reason it doesn’t come naturally for me.

After expressing that she feels unwell, she’ll often get dizzy/almost faint so that I need to help her to bed. To me, it seems like a pattern where when she doesn’t get enough sympathy, she’ll exaggerate her symptoms to see if I’ll help her. 

Last night, she told me that she was feeling ”completely out of it” due to some new medicine she was trying. I tried to express sympathy by saying ”I’m sorry to hear that”. She then sat down in front of the computer and basically collapsed and almost fell out of her chair. She was shaking a little bit and seemed like she was close to vomiting. I helped her to bed and asked if she can talk. She said yes, and I then said that I’m wondring if she exaggerates her symptoms (perhaps subconciously) to test my love. She basically shouted at me saying how hurt she is by that suggestion, and that she’d can’t be with someone who thinks she’s being manipulative and faking her symptoms. 

AITA?

tl;dr Partner often gets worse symptoms after feeling that I don’t sympathize enough. This seems weird to me. I suggested to her that she might be exaggerating her symptoms. She was hurt and angry. AITA?",Asshole,1aqpjbw
"AITA FOR TELLING MY HUSBAND I DON’T WANT A DOG AITA for not wanting him to get a dog until our relationship has improved?

Editing because I've received a lot of helpful feedback and there are too many responses to keep up with.

Summary: My husband wants a K9 for work. It's his #1 dream. We're struggling in our relationship and I'm burnt out with the mental load, household work and toddlers. So I said I didn't want him to get a dog.

Takeaways
1. The dog is not the problem. It's a stressor to the preexisting problems.
   1.1. A K9 will (most likely) require a lot of my husband's attention which means I have to pick up the slack
2. Therapy. I've been wanting to do this but have been met with resistance.
3. He's a gaslighter. I had just recently figured this out but it's nice to be validated.
4. I'm a poor communicator. I already knew this but the relationship struggles made it even worse.
5. I'm burnt out.

Action Plan
1. Be supportive of the dog as long as he's willing to go to marriage counseling to try and improve our relationship.
2. Research K9s and the lifestyle. Then ask a lot of questions to figure out what the new life would look like.
3. Start therapy just for myself to learn how to better communicate, deal with the gaslighting and keep a grip on reality.

I really appreciate the replies. Thank you everyone.

"WIBTA for responding defensively to my dad banning my dog? FINAL UPDATE:
Reddit has spoken I WBTA, and possibly already am.
Thanks folks. Happy consensual dog living 
____
Hi Reddit, I (31 F) am in a bit of a conflict with my dad (61 M). Me and my BF  (33 M) “Joe” have a bundle of joy,“Pip” a 7 year old Aussie doodle. He’s had pip long before me. I never had a dog growing up, my dad doesn’t like dogs. I never disliked dogs, I just didn’t really notice them. Pip is now my baby.

I don’t remember the details of how we got there, but I thought dad had been sufficiently convinced to tolerate Pip after some convo early in dating Joe. I explained what Pip and Joe mean to each other. Joe owns a business and pip goes to work (and everywhere) with him. She’s his child. She has epilepsy and gets very stressed when away from him. Dad responded warmly and we were pretty much done talking about it.

With that, Joe, Pip and I have visited my dad’s house many times. We got together with my dad a couple weeks ago with Pip in tow. Things were fine sans usual grumpy dad things. Fast forward to this weekend. I text my dad: Could we invite a friend couple to join us at your place next weekend for a Memorial Day pool time? Dad: Not feeling it.  I've got to go out of town on business the next day. Me: clarifies I was asking about Saturday, not Monday Dad: What do you propose?

Me: Joe’s best friend + wife/kid would love to come over for pool time. We cook. They will not stay the night Dad: No dogs, no overnighters, y'all host your own. It's going to only reach 70 so it may not be an ideal swimming day.  Bring your own towels please. Me: We will do it another time :) No more dialogue until this morning - Dad: When you come to the house with Pip my heart sinks. It means im going to have a dog in my home for 2 days. You continue to ignore the fact that I don't like dogs. You are all more than welcome but please don't bring a dog to my home”- This feels like my family is not welcome, and will make it very logistically difficult to visit my dad (he doesn’t come out much). Pip could stay with Joes parents but 2 hrs round trip. Joe’s feelings are hurt too. Dad is not afraid of dogs. Pip is quiet, clean, &lt;40lbs and probably actually an angel incarnate.
WIBTA for pushing back on principle (not even to change his mind, but on how meaningful this is and hurt I feel)?

UPDATE: to all that have trashed me for not reading minds, I did respond to my dad, and just heard back:
Me: I promise I was unaware, and certainly not intentionally ignoring, the seething dysphoria you describe. Not a fan of dogs, yes I know. I was under the impression that the risk/benefit around familial relations had concluded a neutral tolerance.
Dad: I thought so too but my heartfelt reaction to seeing a dog off- loading  from the car belies my true feelings.  
Me: Fair.

"AITA for telling my SIL to its rude to crochet everywhere? My SIL does crochet, its literally become her personality. She started doing it after her and my brother experienced a 2nd trimester loss earlier in the year. Now she does it everywhere. I work in the same place she does and I've seen her crocheting at her desk during her breaks and lunch. My brother says it's how she relaxes, apparently it helps calm her busy mind. 

Every week or so, we have family dinners over at my parents house. Since SIL has been crocheting, she brings it with her. She just sits in the corner after dinner working on a project. My brother often sits with her and they'll talk quietly. Both her and my brother are quite introverted. If she ends up sitting with my wife or another sister in law, she's crocheting. 
I recently invited her and my brother to watch a film at mine and again she was sat crocheting through the whole film. It's rude because she's not paying attention to anyone. 

Tonight my brother posted a picture of them where they were out having a couple drinks in the pub. Yet again she was crocheting, it was on the table in the picture. In the comments she was joking with her friends that she'll be able to see where on her wip that she got drunk as it'll be all dropped stitches and she'll have to start again. Her social media is full of posts about crochet. About what she's working on, the yarn or patterns she's bought, or there trips she and my brother take to go to specific yarn stores. I've had enough of her being rude and I commented under the post that it was rude that she kept crocheting everywhere and she needed to stop being so antisocial all the time. She didn't comment back but one of her friends did telling me to eff off and that she can crochet wherever and whenever she wants. I responded by saying in that case crocheting is banned in my house, so she'll have to socialise in future. My brother deleted my comments before SIL got to see them. I know this because he told me when he messaged me telling me that I was being a prick and her crocheting wasn't hurting anyone. He said that she'scurrntly crocheting all the time because she's making gifts for family and friends - bs because we don't do gifts for adults in the family anymore. He told me that they wouldn't be coming around anyone until i apologized to SIL. I'm not apologizing because it's rude not to be giving people your full attention.

"AITA for lying about being an adulteress to my son's girlfriend?  I’m probably a little bit of an asshole in general so my perception might be skewed. My son has been dating Taylor for about nine months and I really dislike her. I know it’s kind of a stereotype for the mom to dislike the girlfriend but she is miserable, judgmental, humorless. I dread spending time with her and I feel like it’s tearing my family apart. 

So I have an adult stepdaughter whose mother lives in France. My stepdaughter has a job that’s done entirely online and travels back and forth but due to covid she was stuck in France for a while and wanted to get back to the US. She has never met Taylor. My stepdaughter finally decided it was safe to come back and my husband picked her up at the airport. 

Anyway Taylor came to me the other day, looking very pleased with herself, and said there was something she thought I should know. She showed me a picture of my husband hugging his daughter at a restaurant. Now if she had not been so morally righteous in the past, I would have appreciated this, but she clearly looks down on my family so I played along and started to cry.

I said I can’t believe he’s done this again and she asked what I meant by that, so I told he had been unfaithful in the beginning of our marriage and I’d retaliated but I’d learned my lesson when I got pregnant with my son and didn’t know who the father was. I then told her we never did a DNA test because I didn’t want my husband to know. She told me that I was disgusting and started to walk off so I told her it was a joke. She was not amused.

"AITA for making my husband miss his best friend’s baby’s birthday? My (26f) husband’s (28m) best friend was having a birthday party for his baby’s first birthday, which I understand is a big deal. However, I recently broke my arm after falling off a ladder, and need a lot of help with daily tasks. I can’t work, cook, drive, and even getting dressed is extremely difficult. since my husband works during the day, I’ve been spending the day for the past couple weeks at my sister‘s, who is a stay at home mom. Now, my husband‘s friend lives in a different town (he moved a couple years ago and my husband knew him since high school), and is about a 3.5 hour drive away. He would have to leave early in the morning and come back late at night. The birthday party took place on Saturday, which is my sister’s busiest day as she has to take her kids to their various activities and run errands, so she’d basically be out of the house the entire day. I knew there was no way she could take care of me, so I told my husband he needed to miss the party. 

Again, I know the first birthday is a big deal, but I wouldn’t be able to take care of myself or do anything for the entire day. I said he could always visit them after I got better, it’s not like the baby’s going anywhere. A birthday party is just a superficial event and is by no means absolutely necessary. 

He was pretty upset about this, and I overheard his conversation with his friend, and he was pretty pissed about it too. The thing is his friend had never broken a bone before, so he had no idea how difficult it was just to get through the day. I think my husband is holding a grudge now. He doesn’t say anything, but I can see that he hasn’t let this go. I told my sister about it afterward and she thinks what I did was awful, but I really don’t see why it’s such a huge deal? idk maybe it‘s because I don’t have kids but I don’t see why missing a birthday party is such a terrible thing, especially given the circumstances.

"AITA for denying my services to someone because of their height? Hi 

I'm a 42female from London and I own my own photography business. I've been a photographer for 16 years now and I've recently been getting a lot of shit for this. 

A couple of weeks ago, a couple came in wanting a maternity shoot which I was more than happy to do. The package was around an hour for the shoot. We sat down to discuss what photos we'd do when the husband speaks. He asks if when we do the pictures where he's behind her with his arms around her, that he stand on a box or something to make himself taller. I must admit that the height difference was amusing. Him at around my height at 5'4 and her at say 5'8. I looked at the wife and asked her what she thought of it. His wife was in agreement to this. She said it was her idea as he's always been a bit self conscious and this made both of them feel better. 

I won't lie, I laughed and shook my head. I thought it was a ridiculous request. It's 2023, a man can be comfortable within himself to not be bothered about things like his height. I asked what they did at their first maternity shoot and apparently they didn't have a professional one (they already have a child) because of COVID so they did their own home phone ones. 

The husband got a bit red either from anger or embarrassment but he asked they could just cut that portion out entirely if the box trick was going to be an issue. Unfortunately I'm on a schedule and I have to do things according to this plan so no, I couldn't just cut a section out. I told them this and they said they wouldn't be needing my services and left. 

I told my friend about how strange this interaction was but she said I should've just done it. It was money and their shoot. Well it's my studio so I have a say in what happens at it? A few other friends have said the same but my sister said it was fair enough. He should've just sucked it up for an hour. Not even that. 

Idk now. I feel bad but I don't? Am I the asshole? Should I invite them back and just do it?


EDIT; To answer what I see in the comments. When I mean schedule, I go through the photos in an order. Set A, B, C, D, so on and so forth. It messes me up when that order is changed and I can't think straight. You're right, it would've taken less time but not for my brain to process. 

Secondly, you're all angry at the fact I said the height amused me. The height difference was amusing. I'd never noticed before but seeing a man who looks like he goes to the gym with tattoos and what not, be shorter than his wife was bizarre to me? I can't explain it. 

I did call them and apologize, offering my services again (with the box) at a reduced rate and they told me they'd think about it.",Asshole,16gqbkn
AITA for trying to save my sister?  My older sister Anna (27) I haven’t seen in almost ten years. Neither has my mom and all of my family. Anna left for college when I was about 10. She dropped all contact and it seemed sad because mom said she had a mental disability and needed her family and all the sudden Anna just disappeared. My mom tried contacting the police and the college but since Anna was 18 they did nothing. It broke my mom’s heart. I heard now Anna was married last year and we heard nothing but my other sibling found her on instagram and tried to reach out and got blocked without an answer explanation. Then we heard Anna had a baby and it is my mom’s first grandchild and my mom sank into a deep depression. After some snooping I found Anna’s address and went to confront her. It was over a two day drive so it took some planning. I found her home and knocked on the door and met Anna’s husband who was angry at me for showing up. I tried to explain the situation about my mom and mom was just trying to do her best for Anna. Her husband treated me like I was the bad person. I thought it was all done and over with but I received a restraining order in our mail. Mom was angry at me and I told her I was trying to help get the family back together. My mom said she gave up on Anna forever ago and yelled at me. It’s not true what my mom said because she has made social media post about her “lost daughter” and complained to everyone about what Anna did and how she doesn’t have her grandbaby in her life. I was trying to help her and now mom called me an embarrassment because I got the courts involved and shamed the family when I was just trying to reach out to my sister. ,Asshole,1dz8o4w

"AITA for always drinking my husband's drinks? My husband and I have our own water bottles that we use and he's really good about having his topped off, always. We also have sodas that we buy that are premium and a little expensive and I limit us to a single can of soda a day. 

I HATE filling up my water bottle. It's annoying having to stand by the fridge and it takes time, and I really use it because of this. The bottle is annoying to keep clean if we use flavor tablets (which I like and we use sometimes). So when I'm thirsty I will often go grab his bottle that's next to him and drink a lot of water out of it. Sometimes I finish it off completely and he gets really mad and in all but words says I'm being an ass by not at least offering to refill the water bottle or clean it occasionally for him as it's a chore. He also gets annoyed in general at me constantly drinking his drinks (or eating off his plate). I will often grab his soda before I open my own and take a big drink out of it and he will say it's not fair that I ""arbitrarily set this rule of one soda per day then drink half of his"" (it's never half - at most a fourth or third). So he will grab another then I'm mad at him as he now has drank 1.75 sodas and they're like $3 apiece.

I grew up in a household where if there's a cup of water we just grab it and drink from it not really caring whose it is (three siblings, two parents) and germs weren't a serious concern among the family.  I will often tell him at a restaurant when they take orders for dessert ""you order something and I'll share it with you"" but he gets so annoyed at me and tells me ""order your own dessert!"" 

I honestly feel like he's being really petty as I've always done this in any previous relationships and with my family (especially my older brother) but he thinks I'm being an AH by doing so.",Asshole,16azrei
"AITA for telling my girlfriend (29F) that her college's open mic is meant for zoomers, rather than older students like her? I (29M) am engaged to this girl named Maaya (29F). I love Maaya so much and we're getting married this coming spring. She's had a rough life, and although she has a degree, she just barely graduated with a 2.0 GPA from college back when she was 24. This was due to the fact that she was both a drug addict and a hikikomori during her college years, and it took her 6 years to graduate from a 4 year program. I met her when she was in the early stages of recovery, and now she's a happy, normal person with her whole life ahead of her.


It's worth mentioning that Maaya is a locally successful musician, and she plays the guitar. She's a bit of a wizard at the guitar, and she can really shred. It's her #1 passion, and she plays both solo and with a band.


Starting this semester, my girlfriend has gone back to college to take remedial courses, because she wants to go to grad school to study applied math. So I applaud her on her efforts to better herself. Her college has a weekly open mic at the campus restaurant, where anyone can come up on stage and perform in a time slot. So I've recently found out that my girlfriend has been performing at these open mics for the past few weeks. When she told me about this, and she told me about how happy it makes her feel to perform in such an intimate setting, ""enjoying her second chance at enjoying a normal college life"" (to paraphrase her own words), I kind of cringed and told her that she was being cheesy. I told her that these kinds of open mics are meant for 19/20-year old zoomers, rather than the semi-professional musicians like her. Looking back, it's an odd thing for me to nitpick about, but I nevertheless believe that this is the truth. When I told Maaya that she was being so cheesy and that she's too old for this kind of stuff, I could tell that her heart was sinking, and she just sort of made these angsty, embarrassed noises.


Later on, I hit up Maaya's instagram page, and I saw that she posted about what I said to her about the open mic. Her post was along the lines of ""who knew something so small can hurt so much"". I was mortified and, honestly, furious that she would embarrass me by posting about our relationship spats so brazenly, and I got into a bitter argument with her that left her crying. By this point, we've made up, and we still love each other so much. AITA?",Asshole,17za6nt
"AITA for forgetting to pack some items for our family vacation? I(m31) and my wife(f28) went on a 3 day family vacation with our 3 kids. A month before, she expressed to me this wouldn't be a vacation for her because she would be organizing all of it, do all the packing, keeping everyone on track. So I told her I would take the packing off her plate and she wouldn't have to do it.

She asked me a few times in the week leading up to vacation if I was going to pack everything or if she needed to do it. I told her I had it handled and she did not need to worry about it. For some context, this is the first time I have packed for a family trip. As i am starting to pack, my wife gave me a list of things we would need and said it was NOT an exhaustive list and so i would need to make sure i had everything. 

Well, I packed up everything I thought we would need. Before i could put the bags in the car she went behind me and checked everything. I had forgotten quite a few things, and they just happened to be ones that were not on her list. Having to go back and get these items caused us to leave late, souring the start of our vacation in her eyes. Now she is mad at me because i didnt know i needed that stuff. Like i said, i havent packed for our vacations before.

"AITA for not giving af about how my husband feels? 
My husband did $100,000 worth of work for my grandparents for free, meaning they only paid for materials and zero labor. He’s a construction worker and so it was hard work, by himself. 

My husband was willing to do the work in exchange of abandoning our highly expensive apartment to staying at my grandparents house. My grandparents said they’re willing to give the section of the house that we built plus the room closest to us for $600 a month. My husband is huffing and puffing because he believes he should be able to stay there for free for the amount of work he did. Also, we’re only planning on staying there for 10 months so we can save enough money to buy land on the beach and then we’re long gone. 

So let me explain what he did so you guys can properly assess the situation. He reroofed 1800sqft of the house, demolished 600sqft of the home and rebuilt it from the ground up. For the 600sqft he built, he had to add a bathroom, install the toilet, tub, vanity, plumbing, ac, electricity, breaker, 10 electrical sockets, 4 windows, two doors, tiling and trims(the whole place is extremely luxurious). I so desperately want to show you a picture of the place before, but to maintain confidentiality I can’t. I’m telling him $600 is a huge steal, but he keeps saying for the amount of work he did it should be free. What do y’all think? 


Edit: My grandparents do not speak English, they are from a different country and have been in this country for over 40 years. I don’t think they know any better because they’re used to people doing work for them for little to nothing. They don’t really know the value of these things, literally. Their house is not paid off and they struggle to pay the bills because they accidentally signed a piece of paper that prolonged the mortgage and increased the monthly payment. They also live in Florida and so the electricity bill is on another level. My grandma is highly disabled and has to go to dialysis 4 times a week and my grandpa has to do every single thing for her so they are unable to work. Even when my grandparents used to work and take care of 7 of us they were only getting paid $4 an hour. The money they got to get all this work done was from insurance because the house was in such bad condition, not because they’re rich. We bring in way more money than our grandparents, to the point where we are saving over 4 grand a month after bills and leisure. He was doing other jobs while doing my grandparents so he made a few extra grand from other jobs while doing my grandparents job. Also, we have a 1 year old and another child on the way so it’s not just me and my husband. I’ve been on bed rest because of this pregnancy and if it wasn’t for them cooking all our meals and babysitting the baby we would lose our minds.

Now, almost everytime I try to talk to her I always need to repeat my words 2-3 times. Either she doesn't hear me at all or she takes off her headphones wanting me to repeat what I said. And it got really annoying after a while. It takes away my motivation to have a conversation with her, and usually I end up saying nevermind or that it wasn't important anyway, making her annoyed because she had to take her headphones off to listen to what I had to say. She gets irritated of background noises easily like a fly flying around, tapping the ground with your feet, eating noises small things like that.

Now I built up the courage and asked her for the first time to stop or wear her headphones less often when I'm around and she was like 'now that's insane to ask' with a serious face in disbelief. I told her that it was annoying to keep repeating my sentences over and over and after that she gave me a gross look and kept quiet.

"AITA for sending my biological son to a boarding school and keeping my autistic stepdaughter with me after my husband died? My husband slept with another woman (his former girlfriend) while married to me and that resulted in them having a daughter. My husband only found out about his daughter after her mom died in a car accident. His daughter was 5 years old at the time and our biological son was 4.

Although it took me some time, I eventually came to love and accept my stepdaughter as my own. I don't even refer to her as a ""step"" child in real life - she is my daughter. My daughter has autism.

My husband died from cancer a year ago. My daughter did not take the news well. She still hasn't accepted her father's death and is waiting for him to come back. 

I knew it would be difficult to handle both my son and daughter all on my own especially given my daughter's mental condition and her inability to accept her father's death. Leading up to my husband's death, my son had also been a bit difficult to handle. Around his birthday, he stole a significant amount of money from my purse, lied to the school headmaster that his grandfather had died, and then skipped class to watch a movie. 

So I decided to send my son to a boarding school. I felt he would get a better education there and I would be able to dedicate more time towards my autistic daughter's needs. 

My parents were shocked when I told them my decision. They said that if I wanted to send someone to a boarding school, it should be my daughter as she is in their words my husband's illegitimate child and not my daughter. 

My son was in tears begging me not to deliberately send him away. He offered to mend his relationship with his (half) sister and listen to everything I said. As tough as it was, I dropped him off in the car hugged him goodbye. 

It's been about year since then and my son is refusing to come back home for the holidays or maintain a relationship with me. He thinks I am only a mom to my daughter and wants to stay away. I've tried calling him on the phone and even visiting him at the hostel but he is not receptive towards me.

"AITA for calling my gf lazy when she refuses to work?  My gf was a senior data engineer at a tech company that had a lot of layoffs and she was also one of the casualties. I use to work for the same company but left about a year ago after the first round of layoffs. I told her she should leave and she began applying but I could tell she didn’t want to leave because she liked her team. Her whole team was let go due to the feature they were working on considered unnecessary.

She got 4 months of severance and it’s been 2 months and she got an unofficial job offer from my friend who is a hiring manager. He was going to hire her and push her through but she turned it down because it was an airline company and she says development work for airlines and just a hiring and layoff cycle. Also that they are paying her about half what she made. I told her she is being unnecessarily picky and she says she refuses to take it because she got 2 interviews in progress for much better companies and taking my friend’s offer would mean that she can’t study and prep for the jobs she really wants. I feel like she is being lazy and she could take this one and also prep for the other interviews and as they are just interviews she is putting too much on the line in case she doesn’t get an offer. With tech how it is she should just take whatever is offered rather than wait for the best job. But she thinks she would rather be unemployed and take a breather and wait for the ideal job.

I told him she isn’t really interested and apologized and joked she has been lazy since she got laid off and thinks she deserves the same income she had and won’t settle for less. He accepted it but I think he told his gf who is friends with my gf who told her I called her lazy and ungrateful. My gf found out and texted me to tell me she is going on a trip to Iceland with friends. This was suppose to be our trip and I was shocked she would just leave. She told me since I think she is lazy and ungrateful she might as well act like it and enjoy her time off and severance. I’m pretty pissed she went on our planned vacation spot without me with her best friend but AITA for “badmouthing” her to my friend? ",Asshole,1eszigs
"AITA for telling my girlfriend I didn’t think she was the type of girl to want me to buy her stuff for Valentine’s? My (29M) girlfriend (25F) and I have been together since March of last year, so almost a year. She is not super materialistic and not really into going to fancy restaurants or spending money on designer clothes and such. I often cook dinner for her and go out of my way to make her feel special and loved. However, the other day she brought up Valentine’s Day and asked me if I have anything planned. I have never been one to celebrate Valentine’s Day, I don’t think I need to spend money just to prove I love my girlfriend.

I told her this and I thought she would agree with me, but she said that she would like if I got her a gift and it we went out to a nice restaurant. I am working on paying off student loans and she knows I don’t have very much money to spend on gifts and fancy dinners. 

She is an artistic, sort of quirky girl and honestly I did not think she was the type to want me to shell out the big bucks and take her to some overpriced crowded steakhouse for a manufactured holiday. It really made me view her differently. 

I told her “I am surprised. I really didn’t think you were that kind of girl.” She went quiet after I said that, and then later accused me of “judging” her for wanting to celebrate Valentine’s. We haven’t brought it up again but I can feel she is still a bit upset about it.

"AITA For stopping child support payments for 1 child but not the other. I have recently had some health issues causing me to be on sick leave. I am no longer receiving and payments from work and it is just my wife's income. We have our daughter together, 3 year old Charlie. (All fake names)

I have 2 other children from 2 previous relationships. 12 year old female (Annie) and 7 year old male (Ben). Neither have a court mandated child support payments. We have just our own arrangements which has been fine for years.

Due to the decrease in income we have had to cut costs. We now only send Charlie to childcare for the free periods provided and are looking at downsizing.

As per my instruction, my wife is now sending child support payments for my Annie, but not Ben. Bens mother has started hiring a cleaner to help around the house, which shows me she has more disposable income. I therefore feel that she doesn't need the child support.

My mother is now angry at me for stopping the payments to Ben if Annie is still receiving them.

I could be the asshole for stopping the payments for Ben, but I don't feel I can afford them and he doesn't NEED them.

"AITA for renovating my daugther's old childhood room without calling her I(38 M)  and the other members of my family have chosen to have the holidays(both Christmas and Thanksgiving) over at my house. My daughter has already moved out and said she will stay with friends this year. In order to make the most use of the free space, I'd decided 3 weeks ago to undergo renovations in my daughter's room and our home office. These renovations meant the destruction of her and the office's connected right internal wall and the mailing of all her things to her po box. Once finished, I called in my family and had them move into the now-renovated bedroom/office for the 3-4 week period between Thanksgiving and Christmas to save money.

Now, the reason I mentioned this is because of yesterday's incident. My daughter, having just started to receive her stuff, called me confused as to why I'd done that. I told her about the renovations, why'd I sent over her things, and to expect more of them over the week.

There was a brief silence (she usually does this when she is uncomfortable) and she explained how she couldn't take most of the stuff into her dorm on short notice and that she wished that I had told her the plan before renovating or moving anyone in. I told her that since she moved out the room was mine to do what I wanted with and that I couldn't hold any of her stuff as I already shipped it. I've come to regret being as irrated as I was and feel as if I could have involved her more but I was already on a tight deadline with the renovation and needed to move out as much stuff as possible fast. Aita?

Update: So after my family and I finished eating, I called my daughter to see where she currently stands. She's ignored me for a bit but she just texted me asking if I'd finished sending her things(to which I answered yes) and that she intends to spend Christmas at her same friend's house.

A few minutes later, I saw a lady coming in with groceries and didn't think to open the door. I had a lot on my mind with other things, so it completely slipped my mind. When she came in, and I tried going through the door with her, she said ""Since you couldn't open the door for me, you can't come in.""

"AITA for saying it makes me uncomfortable to buy tampons for my wife? EDIT: TO clarify what I meant by ""indulge"", Google dictionary says it also means--

&gt;to give somebody/something what he/she/it wants or needs

That's what I meant by using the word.

&amp;#x200B;

I (31 M) was supposed to buy a bunch of medicines at the drug store because we were running low. When I told my wife (30 F) that I was going, she asked me to also purchase tampons/sanitary napkins for her in the process.

I had never done it before as she's usually the one who makes such purchases. I got kind of uncomfortable and asked her whether she can't buy it herself, and she said it would be much easier if I buy it myself as I am going anyway. She said it makes no sense why she would have to go again herself, and asked whether I had a problem.

I told her that it would look weird for me to ask for one as I am a guy, and that I am not comfortable indulging in such things that are meant for ladies. I made it clear that some of the medicines I was going to buy are also meant for her, so it's not as if I don't care about her. And she was the one who's been buying such stuff for so long anyway.

She was upset and accused me of being very much inconsiderate, and also called me sexist. She said that no matter what I said, I don't care about her and that I don't deserve to call myself a man or her husband as I won't help her.

I responded by saying she was overreacting because I won't get something she perfectly can by herself, and that it's true I am not comfortable making such purchases. She wasn't even incapable of getting it, she was going to work and could have bought it the same day and absolutely nothing would have been affected.

"AITA for not letting my son go to homecoming over grades My son lives with his dad and is a freshman in high school.  His dad asked if our son could go to homecoming as it is on my weekend. I initially said no because I live an hour away and only see him 4 days a month, but his dad offered to switch weekends so i was considering letting him go.

However, i checked his grades and saw that he has a D in one of his classes.  I emailed the teacher and she said he has been on his phone in class and unfocused and not doing assignments complete.

I texted my ex who told me he has been working with the teacher, counselor and assistant principal and our son for the last 3 weeks but the teacher has been relatively non responsive, gives students 0s if they don’t follow all instructions to a T, and takes forever to update grades after the students fix the problems.  He told me he already turned our sons phone off during school hours as punishment and the D is due to one 200 point assignment where our son received a 0 for not taking notes correctly in class and he is working with the teacher to help him redo it and turn it in the right way and the teacher allegedly said he could do this.  He also claims he has been in contact with all his other teachers and he is not acting up in their classes and this instance was specifically when there was a sub in class.  Needless to say I have difficulty believing my ex as I am sure he does not want to admit our son is not doing as great as he thought he would be in his care.

My ex also is attributing our son’s academic issues on being new to high school and the school district and is blaming me for “not having any oversight and enabling him” the last 4 years and him switching schools a few times and that “his last school district was not good and he never learned any good study habits”.  Which is ridiculous because I tried very hard to get my son back on track when he was with me until my ex got the judge to move him to his district. Also his dad is enabling him now by trying to get me to let him go to homecoming when he is almost failing a class??

I texted my ex and my son and said absolutely not, no homecoming dance due to the D and his bad behavjor in class, that I will not reward bad behavior and bad grades.  I also explained to my son that homecoming is for juniors and seniors anyway and he will have the next 3 years to attend.

"AITA for not letting my son use his college fund for auto mechanic school and opening a garage? My husband died last year and it hit my oldest Carson (17M) really hard. They were always really close even after Carson came out a couple of years ago. Both of them had a passion for cars, bikes, and practically any motor vehicle. They bonded over it while they would fix and repair old cars and bikes and sometimes Carson's boyfriend Thomas(17M) another gear head would helpe out.

 Now initially Carson wanted to be a doctor like his dad. We even set up a college fund that would cover even medical school. We're almost a quarter into his senior year and last week he tells me that he doesn't want to go to college anymore. He wants to go to an auto mechanic school with Thomas and then open a garage with him. He ask me if Id let him use his college fund for that. Now his college fund isn't officially labeled as such so  theres no penalty for using it however but I want him to go to an actual school and really do something with his life. The kid makes straight As and is wicked smart he's getting athletic and academic scholarships.. I told him no and my reasons why.

He tells I'm not being fair trying to control his life like that. He yells at me that I can't force him to be a doctor. I try to explain that he doesn't have to be one but I want to him get an actual degree and make real money rather than probably getting stuck just fixing cars.

"AITA for not closing my window when having sex? I (26f) have a neighbour who is a girl aged around 19 (I don’t know her age specifically) who lives with her family. I don’t know much about her, but I see her every day out on her balcony smoking. She doesn’t seem to ever be out her house and seems to be slightly odd. Besides that, I had no problem with her.

About roughly 2 weeks ago, me and my partner were engaging in s*x when he opened the window because we were getting hot. After about 15 mins, I can hear that girl shouting up from her balcony saying “I can hear you clapping” “can you close your window”. My partner kept looking out our window at her to check if she was still there and she started saying “are you gonna close the window now then” every time he looked out. The very next day I was outside my block talking with some neighbours when she came walking past giving me a really dirty look. I just ignored her.

Yesterday me and my partner were making love again, when about 10 mins in I hear her again basically saying the same things as last time. This time I looked out and said “can you mind your own business please, you’re embarrassing me”. She replied “then stop opening your windows, nobody wants to hear that, it’s disgusting. What about how I feel?”. I wasn’t about to argue out windows so I just closed my window but me and my partner were put off after that.

Now today her mother pointed us out when we were leaving our block, asking us to “close your windows when you’re shagging” and that we’re apparently making her daughter uncomfortable and that she has PTSD. I told her that her daughter is making ME uncomfortable when shouting up to us while we try to make love.

Basically she wasn’t having it and threatened us saying if it happened again she was going to make a report for “anti social behaviour”. Are we actually doing something wrong here? AITA?

"AITA for grounding my son for lying to us about having a boyfriend and sleeping over at his house? So I’m posting here at the recommendation of my sister, who thinks I’ve messed up.

I (m46) and my wife (f46) have a son “Brian” (m16).  Brian is a smart and wonderful kid but a bit distant, spends most of his time in his room.  We’ve always had a somewhat difficult time getting along with him, but he gets good grades and behaves.  Brian goes to a college prep program HS in our city and is involved in many after-school activities and has a car to get around for them.  My wife and I both work so we can’t drive him everywhere he needs to go.  Also, we have made it clear since he was young that spending the night at a girlfriend’s house is a no-no.

Brian has never dated, we figured he was just a late bloomer, but last spring he made varsity soccer and befriended a senior teammate, “Luke” (m18).  Luke invited Brian to his graduation party and after that they started hanging out a LOT over the summer.  Brian started to spend the night at Luke’s house multiple times a week, which is unusual behavior.  (I also checked Brian’s computer and found gay porn, but kept this to myself.)  We confronted him because he was out of the house 2-3 nights a week and he denied that he and Luke were having sex.  It turned into a yelling match.  Luke left for college in August and the subject was dropped.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, Brian came home and broke down crying after a swim meet and finally confessed that Luke had broken up with him over the phone at some point this semester because he couldn’t do long distance.  We comforted him and were very glad he finally opened up and we learned the truth.  However I informed him that he would be grounded from his car and some other things because he lied to my wife and I about having a boyfriend and sleeping at his house.

He absolutely lost it and told us he wished he never said anything (which hurt our feelings) but did so because he “couldn’t take the pain anymore.”  He said I have said some homophobic things in the past (Disney shouldn’t have gay days, non-reproductive sex is dysfunctional, Gay porn is disgusting, etc.) and said he never felt comfortable telling us.  I told him frankly I don’t even remember saying those things, and I think they’re irrelevant/excuses for the fact that he lied about dating someone behind our backs.  Brian (like usual) stormed into his room and slammed the door.

Brian’s grades and sports performance are now falling, he says because he has to coordinate rides everywhere and because he can’t hang out with his friends, but I feel taking away his car and friend time is the right punishment because he lied about sleeping over at his boyfriend’s house.

"AITA for apparently not following plane etiquette  Okay so I recently came home from a month long work trip I live in Georgia but have been in Oklahoma for the last month away from my friends and family. 

On the day of my plane ride home I got to the airport and decided I had no use for the carry on bag that I had dealt with on the trip to Oklahoma so I decided to check it along with my previously checked bag that way all I would have to deal with was my computer backpack and not have to drag a carry on around with me since I also had a lay over of about 2 hours, and I thought if I have no carry on then I hopefully can get off the plane quicker. 

I have an aisle seat on the plane and as soon as we start to land at my final destination in Georgia. I already have the arm rest up flipped so I can get up quicker. When the seat belt light goes off I get out of my seat quickly and go up the aisle as fast as I can since I was in the 2nd to the last row of the plane I walked past a lot of people. Each row on this plane was 6 seats with the aisle going down the middle. I got over halfway towards the front before I ran into the line of other people waiting to exit. 

As I moved up the aisle I rushed past a guy who was just starting to get up and I said excuse me and did not touch him or bump him at all but he got angry with me and told me I was being rude AF by doing what I did and not following etiquette. There was about 12 rows from where he was to where I ended up stopping to wait. So in my mind I skipped waiting on 36 people. 

I waited patiently as the few people I got stopped behind all waited and let row after row of people out and I watched as they all fiddled with their bags after getting them out of the overhead compartment and yeah it annoyed me to wait but I never said a word I was just happy I skipped waiting on over half the plane. 

I got to the baggage claim and got to see my wife and son whom I’d been away from for a month and why I wanted off the plane because I missed them. The guy from the plane ran into me at baggage claim and called me an asshole for rushing to the front on the plane. He then said I was an asshole when I said I just didn’t see a point and waiting if I had no carry on and that I just wanted to see my family. 

He told me that I was still a jerk and asshole because he saw me also not let some people who were still in their row out into the aisle like everyone else was and instead I just walk past them. 

So am I the asshole? 

Edit: No one got slammed or bulldozed it wasn’t like a Black Friday sale I just bypassed waiting on a bunch of people I didn’t want to wait on. The guy who called me out wasn’t even in the aisle.

The problem is that the only thing bigger than my vocabulary is my appetite for the fairer sex. I regularly compliment women when I pass them on the street but I of course always do so in a polite, courteous and sensual manner. They almost always respond positively.

Yesterday I was walking with a colleague of mine when I passed a woman who rivaled Aphrodite. It pained me that the rest of her undoubtedly luscious lips and assuredly earth-shattering smile were obscured by a mask. She walked by and I couldn't help but mutter ""Simply pulchritudinous.""

She turned around as red as Mars (in both senses) and told me to fuck off. I was shocked. I've never had a woman react like that about my word choice. Most are titillated, not ticked. My friend insisted that she just felt embarrassed because she didn't know the definition so she lashed out, and I'm inclined to agree with that.

But I'm still worried that it my vocabulary may be more off-putting than I initially thought.

My daughter grew up with, and went to high school and college with a very friendly guy who passed away early this year at the age of 24. All of my kids were good friends with this person, and my sons took him under their wings as the young man grew up.



When they were in high school and college together, I was convinced that my daughter and her friend had a thing, and that in fact they were more than just friends.

And although I say this half-jokingly, my main thought about their relationship was: when was he going to propose to her?

On Saturday evening, my daughter got drunk, and she spent the night reminiscing about the young man and viewing short clips of them having fun in high school a decade ago. My daughter’s face was red the entire time, and I know that it was because she was drunk. However, I sat down with her, and I jokingly told her “I can see that you’re blushing just looking at him”.

He brought the kids but they wouldn't get out of the car no matter how many times I asked and even told them to.

I've been texting and calling my ex since yesterday to have him put the kids on the phone and pass on my messages but he says they still don't want to talk to me. I thought I was doing the right thing and that my kids would understand but was I wrong for leaving them with my parents this whole time?

Eta: the hospital is an hour away from where we live

"AITA for calling my cousin ""selfish"" on her wedday day after she said I was ""no fun"" and that ""nasal allergies aren't a big deal"" ? I (21f) have really bad nasal allergies. My cousin (26f) had her wedding last Sunday. I was there, and it was outdoors. Lots of flowers. I tried very hard to not let my sneezing, sniffling, and nose blowing be a distraction. 
      At the reception, I was a mess. My cousin asked if I had the flu and I told her it's just allergies. She held my hand and lead me onto the dance floor. She tried to get me to dance but I was worried about my nose. I left the dance floor and she followed me. 
          She asked what's wrong and I told her my allergies. She said I was no fun and nasal allergies aren't a big deal. I told her she was selfish and she doesn't care that I'm not feeling well. She called me a word and walked away. Am I the asshole ?",Asshole,1mokzjh
"AITA because I will not pay for my daughter’s ugly eyeglasses, but WILL buy her normal frames? We generally support our kid in her personal style/fashion/appearance decisions. She’s 14f.  When we go back to school shopping she has a spending limit, but she is allowed to buy anything that’s within the dress code. She’s allowed control over her own hair with some restrictions (if she wants a major change she needs to let me know, and if she still wants it done after one month, we get it done).  
  
We have however clashed on the issue of eyeglasses. The “cool” thing right now is these thick, chunky glasses that look absolutely ridiculous on anyone, but especially a young kid with a small face. Think the kind of glasses you’d expect on the “quirky” art teacher or an art gallery owner.   
  
The best I can come up with is if you look up “Jubilee Geometric” but those frames aren’t nearly as thick as the ones she wanted. Add neon and stripes. Then she showed me some that are heart shaped with thick rims.  
  
I told her that she can absolutely use her allowance and birthday/Christmas money towards any “quirky” glasses she wants. But we have to buy her a “boring” pair to wear around the house or when she needs to be more “serious.” She got really worked up about this and told me that I’m being tyrannical and stifling her self expression.  
  
I would never tell her this, ever, but all those hideous thick chunky frames remind me of the “quirky” girls back in college who thought they were “different” and “unique” because they bought clothes from ModCloth and thought they were the only ones who could sew/knit or thrift and all that.

"AITA for telling my parents about my cousin doing weed? So for context me and my cousin are both 14 and she is going through a of a tough phase right now and is struggling a bit with her mental health and eating properly and stuff but ill start explaining

And well me and my cousin like to talk to each other about stuff we wouldn't tell anyone else and the stuff my cousin has been within the last few months getting extremely drunk vaping, stealing a ridiculous amount from shops and did some weed with her friends she found on the side of the road.

And I'm like a very well behaved person, I focus a lot on my studies, I never get into trouble, rarely do anything irresponsible so I don't hanf out with many people who do stuff like this so idk if it's normal.

But I'm just really concerned about her, like this stuff could seriously harm her later in life, and with all the vodka she's illegally buying she could even do something stupid and get killed, or get a crininal record from all the stuff she's stealing.

"AITA for refusing to call French lawyers for my American partner when I already studied the situation? My American partner is moving to France, where I'm from. The immigration rules, just like most of French law, is not only available online in its original form, but also on another government website translated in laypeople's terms. Between reading this extensively, my partner being American, being the child of an immigrant myself, and just growing up here, I'm confident in the path to take to getting them a residency permit. But as my partner is anxious about it, a friend of them ChatGPT'd a list of immigration lawyers they could try to get free information from, though they might not speak English. As they don't speak French, my partner wants me to make those calls, but as I consider this to not be useful and to be trying to pry out information out of people who don't work for free nor for cheap, I don't want to. With that said, in situations where they wants to do things that require speaking French while I'm not interested or not available, which happened for other things in the past (there are situations where I'm available and happy to though), I offered to pay for someone from a cheap services subreddit to do it, which my partner rejected, saying that as a partner, it should always be me, and I should always say yes, which I disagree on.

"AITA for asking about a trip refund? Hey Reddit, I need perspective.

I paid my share for a group trip (Airbnbs included). On the day of the trip, I couldn’t go because of a medical issue. This was supposed to be my first trip ever, I haven’t even been inside an airport and so missing it was extremely disappointing and heartbreaking. The money I contributed was my only savings, which I had invested in this trip.

I had to ask my friends, which was really uncomfortable for me, to refund my share. They said they can’t because of extra costs they had during the trip because of me and one of them even said it’s “unfair to them” that I asked. I didn’t cancel to inconvenience them, and I feel like basic fairness and empathy are being ignored. I didn’t use the accommodation at all and only asked for the money back whenever possible.

For context, the overall contribution which needs to be refunded is around $100 per person (4 persons to refund it)

AITA for asking the refund? I can't help but feel hurt, frustrated and angry over this.

"AITA for not attending my friend's two weddings? \[edited for length\]

I (36F) have a situation with one of my bffs (45M) that I think is putting a wedge between us. My friend, let’s call him Adam, got married to Eve (38F) 1.5 years ago. They had 2 weddings (a normal one and a Chinese one) and I was invited to both. I’ve been a really close friend of Adam’s for many years. We used to live in the same city and Adam would always invite me as his “date” to galas and other events, take me to nice dinners, introduce me to really interesting people like professional athletes, artists and other people he knows. And before you ask— we never dated, while he has a heart of gold Adam isn’t my type. We did make out once or twice, but nothing serious. I moved to a city a few hours away and since then I haven’t seen Adam as often, though we still text regularly. About 3 years ago he met Eve and had a whirlwind relationship and got engaged after about a year. I haven’t met Eve but she seems nice enough, though I get the sense her travel schedule between her homes is part of why I never see Adam anymore.

Now, to the wedding. Adam used to make my birthday a REALLY big deal — we’d always go out and go to a really nice show and a high end meal, dress up etc. I guess for me it was always a bit like our friendship anniversary night. So I was surprised when I saw the first wedding was supposedly taking place on my birthday weekend. I called Adam and told him would he think about changing the date, because I was planning something with friends in my city and I couldn’t imagine him not coming. He had never been to my city before and I thought now that my live-in boyfriend and I called it quits, he could come stay the weekend, too, and see my city and life around here. It was only a “save the date,” so I figured there was still time to change it and it wasn’t even the big Chinese one. When we talked on the phone, not only did he say he couldn’t change the date, but also he refused to honor my request to not invite an ex of mine (I will not attend any event with this man there, and Adam knows this). I admit I might have gotten heated on the phone.

A few months after that, Adam texted me if I’m going to attend the Asian wedding and if I can update my RSVP one way or another since there’s a lot of people to account for. I just ignored him because I felt so disrespected from the last time we talked, and figured with all the relatives and aunties coming over from China that he wouldn’t be able to get an accurate headcount anyway. I did send him a nice entryway mat for his house off the gift registry just to try to smooth things over.

Since then, we still text pretty frequently but I feel things are “off” and I miss the connection we used to have. Adam recently visited my city for some job-related stuff and didn’t even make time to hang out. I’m beginning to wonder if maybe I was too harsh in declining to come to both his weddings and that’s hurt our friendship. AITA?",Asshole,1daqfmp
"AITA for defending my mom after my boyfriend was rude to her? My boyfriend(19m) and I(19f) have known each other since we were kids. His mother recently passed away.

"AITA the asshole for asking my wife to wear a t-shirt over her bikini when we were at the beach with friends? I’m 31 male, wife is 29 female. Recently over the Easter break we went on a vacation; me, her and our young 3 year old son.  We were staying in a beach area and it was really bright and sunny.  We ran into two friends of mine by pure chance.  We were later hanging out at the beach and my wife was wearing a bikini, but I was wearing a shirt.  I couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable and insecure cause I know these two guys, I know what they’re like and how they talk, I know they’ll be “looking” at her.  I didn’t say anything and I kept quite for the day while she hung out with them and went swimming while I mostly hung around our son and looked after him at the beach and took him to the park and playground.

Later that evening I broached the topic with my wife.  I told her I’d feel more secure if she wore a shirt over her bikini top.  She did not take it well and got quite upset and angry.  To me she’s incredibly beautiful and is the most beautiful woman I’ve seen in my life, both face and body, but to her she’s been historically very insecure about her body especially her chest. She’s mentioned many times wanting a reduction surgically and how she hates having a big chest and how she thinks it’s not feminine and ugly and not beautiful ( I disagree but i don’t invalidate her point of view). 

She did not take well to my suggestion even though I tried to explain why.  She said I was making her feel ashamed of her body even though that wasn’t my intention. I just said I don’t want two lecherous guys who I know very well staring at her in that way and probably later making comments to each other.  She didn’t buy it and was pissed off at me.

Next day she was angry at me the whole day and in a sour mood and again we spent the day at the beach, she ignored my suggestion about the t shirt completely,  she hung out with them going walking and swimming while I stayed and looked after our son the entire time.

On the drive back home she was angry and still ignoring me.  I tried to apologise but I think I might have crossed a line and inadvertently made her insecure over her body and brought back old memories of insecurity

"AITA for commenting on my bf's karaoke performance and leaving when he didn't change the thing I asked him to? First time posting here so sorry for any mistakes and what not.

So me (32f), my boyfriend (31m) of 9 years and his friend (let's call him Mike) went to a concert today. We were having a lot of fun, but at some point my boyfriend left to another room.

He was already drunk quite a bit so I asked him to eat something and chill with the drinking a bit. He ate some peanuts but kept on drinking beer.

I went back to the concert and after a while wrote him a msg asking if he was okay, he didn't respond so I went looking for him and found him in a different room - at the karaoke.

My boyfriend loves to sing, he is not bad at it, but he tends to scream and get louder the more beer he has flowing in his veins.

After the first song I told him to hold his mic further from his face, because it was getting really loud at times, he was basically screaming into the mic held less than an inch from his mouth and the noise was defening. Other people were having fun, but it also made them a bit uncomfortable.

He sang 4 more songs, after each I asked him politely to keep the mic further, he was too excited about the singing and the people clapping to listen. I feel bad for raining on his parade but it really was bothering (at least) me how loud it was. After 5th song I decided to leave, it was too much for me to handle, he was getting more and more loud, more drunk, so I left him with Mike (he said he will take care of him - we'll see about that tho). He started apologizing to me with a sad puppy demeanor that he ""sings badly"" which was never my point, I just wanted him to sing more pleasantly for all of the listeners. 

He seemed sad and broken, but I believe I really wasn't asking too much of him - he could've either slow down with the drinking (and thus not scream so much) or keep the mic further away (so his screams would be less annoying).

Or should I just let him scream bloody murder and I'm just a party pooper and was too harsh?

AITA?


Edit: Thanks everyone for chiming in, I do believe I was the asshole and should've just left earlier as I was not enjoying myself and keep it to myself. It might've been just me who got bothered by his screaming, but even if not it wasn't my problem to handle how the crowd percieved him or if he would be hurt if anyone started booing etc.

He came back safe an hour later, I apologized but he basically fell asleep right away, so we'll talk about it again tomorrow.



To add some context if it might be helpful for anyone in a similar situation;
Yes I have problem with controlling behaviour on my part, I'm also an ACA which causes me to act more uneasy when in an unfamiliar surroundings with severely drunk people, especially when I'm sober myself.

My boyfriends is easily hurt by criticism, and it made me very vigilant of how other's percieve him, it also made me careful with my words and contrary to some comments I really wasn't nagging him, but asking nicely and politely, between the praises I gave him. It was only when I left and said it's too much for me that he got sad and started apologizing (which I refused! as I didn't want him to feel like he needed to apologize to me).

I also didn't ruin anyone elses night, people at the karaoke didn't notice me telling him to move the mic, nor they were cheering him on and demanding him to sing, most of the time they were keeping to themselves - which I should learn from I guess.

The drinking and not having restraint is a whole other issue, but I won't get into that. Some people clocked it tho, thanks for that.",Asshole,1ns78xu
"AITA for refusing to go to my uncle’s wedding because it’s on Halloween? I (16F) will be 17 on Halloween 2025. Halloween is really important to me—I love everything spooky, and I was especially excited for this one since it feels like my last chance to fully enjoy the holiday as a kid.

My uncle and his fiancée recently announced that they’re getting married on Halloween. They have a baby together, and she has three kids from previous relationships. When I heard about the wedding, I immediately asked how my cousin (my uncle’s daughter from a previous relationship) felt about it, and she was upset too.

I told my mom I didn’t want to go and that I wanted to spend Halloween with my boyfriend or friends instead. She wasn’t happy about that and told me that everyone else in the family was excited, and that my uncle and his fiancée were planning to have candy for the kids, and that I could participate in that. But I’m going to be 17—I don’t want to spend my night out grabbing from a random candy bowl with little kids when I could be out having fun.

My mom thinks I’m being selfish and that skipping a family wedding just to go trick-or-treating is immature. I get that this is a big day for my uncle, but I feel like they chose an inconvenient date for a lot of people, and I don’t think I should have to give up my plans just because they picked Halloween.

"AITA for asking a girl if she was sure? I (20M) am in a college class that requires a group project as the final. I go to a pretty good school, so most people there, myself included, are very intellectual. My group consisted of myself, three other people that have a more scholarly demeanor, and one girl, who we'll call L, who is not quite this way. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with people like this, but she's very bubbly and outgoing, is a cheerleader and sorority member, and is honestly sometimes a little childish in the way that she interacts with people, i.e. talking to us like we're her friends rather than classmates. While the rest of us will sit down and immediately get to work in a group meeting, she will ask us how our days/weekends were, what we did, etc. Again, I don't see anything inherently wrong with this and can appreciate that she makes the group environment more fun.

However, the rest of us naturally tend to take each other more seriously in terms of information for the project. The way I see it, the time that L spends at parties and with friends is spent by the rest of us challenging and charging our minds, so it's only natural that we are more inclined to listen to more professionally-charged ideas. Unfortunately, this has culminated in more than one instance where L will give an idea, the other group members will more or less disregard it, and someone else will say virtually the same thing and be praised for their genius. When this happens, L will just sink into herself and concede that the other members probably know better. I know it's unfair, but I don't really think it matters who gets the credit as long as the project gets done well, and this just demonstrates L's lack of confidence in her own ability. If she doesn't believe in herself, why should we?

Today, we came across a problem that had a bit of a crossover with environmental studies (an environmentally-friendly solution was one of the criterion), and L immediately piped up with a solution since environmental science is her major. The group didn't really address her solution and continued to think of others, but we weren't really getting anywhere. L rephrased her solution, but since she was so uncertain in herself throughout the project, I really wanted to make sure she had thought this through. I asked if she was sure and if she could do more research, and she said ""I don't need more research, this is my major and I know what I'm doing"". At first, I thought she was needlessly aggressive, but after thinking about it, I can see how someone would be frustrated at a group for constantly shooting down their ideas, even for someone as farcical as L.

AITA?

EDIT: Some people have asked and no, we are not all men. There is another woman in the group who is taken just as seriously as the rest of us. It isn't about that.

EDIT2: No, I don't stand up for L when her ideas are taken. That robs her of the opportunity of learning how to stand up for herself.",Asshole,137siee
"AITA: Unfunny April fools prank on my parents?  When I was 16 I almost died of alcohol poisoning and my parents found me half dead lying in the road.

Fast forward 11 years, I moved away, excelled in college, got a masters degree, have begun my career and am doing very well with my mental health after lots of work and self care.

"AITA for criticising my child's parents? I (23M) got my best mate, Damon (19FTM), pregnant. He's clung to me as if i was his entire world ever since, and that only intensified after he gave birth to our daughter a few months ago.

We weren't ready to raise her, Damon a Cambridge drop out and I'm a broke film student. We went with an open adoption, thinking it was the best option for her. Damon has never been able to let go. He still calls her by the name he picked, even though her adoptive parents, Laura and Mark, changed it. He can't stop talking about how she looks like me, like she's this perfect reflection of us.

Whenever we visit, Damon tunes out Laura and Mark. He'll say all the right things to them, acting polite, but he's really just focused on me and the baby. He'll hold her and whisper things like, ""Look at her hair, it's just like yours,"" or ""She's got your eyes, your little smirk."" He completely ignores the fact that she's being raised by other people. Damon hates how perfect and polished Laura and Mark are, he's jealous of the life they're giving her. He's also desperate to have another baby with me. He's convinced it would fix everything, that this time, we'd be be a family. He keeps saying, ""We could do it right this time"" but I keep telling him we're not ready. Damon won't listen. He's convinced having another baby would make everything better.

Last week, it all came to a head. We were visiting Laura and Mark, and as usual, Damon was glued to the baby, still calling her the name we gave her. He was holding her, running his hand through her hair, and said, ""She's going to be tall like Jarvis. She's already got his legs. She's going to grow up lanky and awkward, just like him."" Laura's smile got tighter and tighter, clearly uncomfortable.

Later, Laura pulled me aside. She told me it's ""confusing"" for the baby to have us around like this, and that Damon's not co-operating. She suggested we step back for the baby's sake. That's when I snapped. I told her, ""We agreed on an open adoption. You don't get to shut us out because we don't fit into your perfect life."" Mark chimed in, saying they're just thinking about what's best for the baby, but I pushed back, saying Damon loves that baby more than they'll ever understand.

Damon overheard and broke down afterward. In the car, he was mad, saying, ""You shouldn't have said anything, Jarvis. They'll cut us off now. We need to be grateful."" He's terrified that we'll lose the baby completely, and now he's even more desperate to have another one convinced it's the only way to fix things. It felt right in the moment but a part of me wonders if I've made things worse by standing up to them.

Everyone around us says we should be thankful the baby is in a good home. Now I'm questioning if I pushed too hard and if Damon's right that I should've stayed quiet.",Asshole,1fn5ohd
"AITA for not deleting a girl from my Snapchat? Bear with me please I want to make sure I give you all the context. I (31m) am in a relationship with my fiancé (29f). She seems to be an insecure person, which I’ll admit, she wasn’t before me. Like when my best friend broke up with his girlfriend and I started reaching out to her, my fiancé told me that I looked like a predator trying to talk to a vulnerable girl. Anyway. I have a friend (Emily) who often invites my and my fiancé to family parties, at one of these parties I met my friends sister (Sarah). Sarah and I hit it off. We talked and laughed for a good portion of the night. I guess my fiancé was mad about it because I heard from my friends mom that she noticed that we were talking and that my fiancé seemed upset. That night my fiancé mentions that I was a little too touchy with Sarah and she was uncomfortable with the way we interacted. 

Anyways, Emily invites me to an outing. I go with her and her husband but my fiancé is working. Sarah shows up for a while. We talked and we had fun. She seems like a really good person. No big deal. I didn’t tell me fiancé because I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. We’ll later at another function Sarah mentioned the outing out loud and my fiancé heard so it became a big deal. She asked me why I didn’t tell her and I told her that it wasn’t any of her business and she was overreacting. 

So here’s the deal. I found Sarah on Instagram and I messaged her to ask her for her Snapchat so that we could talk more freely. She even asked me if I would get in trouble and I said no I’m not doing something bad. Well my fiancé saw a notification from her and lost it. She asked me why I would add someone that she’s uncomfortable with and why I would think that talking to her on Snapchat is okay. I told her that she can’t tell me who I can be friends with. She said that I needed to remove her from my Snapchat and I said no that she can’t tell me what to do. It’s not my fault she’s insecure. So am I the asshole for refusing to remove my friend?

"AITA For refusing to go over to my friends house due to her kids My friend recently moved to this area. I am extremely close with my friend and her husband and their two kids, so while she was getting settled I let her and her two kids stay with me. Their kids are the same age as my kids. They are seven and nine. My kids have very strict rules about which areas of the house are play areas and which aren't. They also know that if someone is watching TV or eating you don't go running all over furniture and be super loud. My friends kids, despite explaining the rules to them several times don't seem to understand boundaries or appropriate inside behavior. My friend recently rented a house and much to my joy she is going to move out. I explained to her I would appreciate if when I came over kids were not running all over the place when we were eating or talking or watching TV. I requested that there be a portion of the house that is play and a portion where the adults can hang. She refused and said her house her rules. AMITA for saying I don't feel comfortable visiting her house and anytime we hang out it will have to be at my house?

Update. I am also responding to bad mom friend
1. I realize that requesting that of my friend was inappropriate. Instead, I will extend invites over to my place and politely decline her invites unless it is something big like birthday parties etc. 
2. My kids have been taught to clean up after themselves. There are times where they will forget and will need a reminder, but kids will be kids. Her kids are allowed to make messes and usually mom or dad pick up after them. In the case of toys in the hallway, I had asked one of my kids and one of her kids to clean up a giant mess they made in one of my kids rooms. Their solution was to throw everything in the hallway. Since it was the second time asking the mess to get cleaned up, I used a stern voice, but did not yell.
3. Her kids are allowed six to ten hours of tablet time a day. It is not my place to police other parents children's screen time. The problem is her kids are allowed to play the tablet at full volume anywhere they want. If you are watching TV too bad. If you are on the phone too bad. Since my table is behind my couch I did make a rule that there were no tablets at the table. It was hit or miss if it was followed. 
4. I, like any parent do lose my cool and will occasionally yell at my kids or get into arguments with my kids. This is usually followed by me reiterating what rules I needed followed, but more importantly what I could have done better. I feel it is important kids see their parents admitting when they didn't handle a situation well. My friend went off on one of her kids the other week for interrupting  her TV episode. That is something that happens frequently. She will exaggerate the frequency that something occurs and will act blameless. 
5. I feel her kids are out of control and sometimes that will lead to things like a kid getting hurt. I did ban a certain game, but when I cooled down and realized my kid was fine I realized my request was not reasonable. 
6. My friend has done a lot for me and my family and vice versa. We just have drastically different ways of raising our kids and at times that can create conflict.
7. Lastly I am not sure where people are getting the idea that I believe kids should be seen and not heard. The majority of my house is the kids playroom as is the backyard and front yard. My kids have been taught that if they need to make a request or ask a question when people are talking or watching TV or on the phone or trying to sleep or read they can. They can't be jumping all over the place and yelling and screaming when people are engaged in other activities. It is disrespectful. ",Asshole,1nt13so
"AITA for wanting to see a dog I'm 32M and my girlfriend ""Grace"" (30F) has a best friend named ""Sierra"" (30F). About two weeks ago, Sierra adopted a Dachshund named Pizza from the shelter. Pizza was abused in his first home and Sierra described him to Grace as ""reactive and terrified of men"". Sierra and her brother are working together to slowly expose him to being around men, and she has said that she doesn't expect Pizza to ever feel fully comfortable around them, but she hopes for him to eventually be able to stay in the same room as one without showing aggression. Personally, I don't think they're doing this fast enough and I think they're enabling the dog's irrational fear.

Last night, I dropped Grace off at Sierra's house for dinner as I do every month. I asked if I could go inside and see Pizza. Grace made a strange face and said that I never ask to go into Sierra's house, and that she didn't think it was a good idea because it might freak Pizza out. I told her that Sierra needs to stop coddling him and letting him rule her house. Grace said to just let Sierra handle it because she knows what she's doing.

I normally just text Grace when I've arrived to pick her up, but this time I went to Sierra's front door. I could see Grace and Sierra sitting on the couch finishing their wine and watching TV with Pizza sleeping in between them. I knocked loudly on the door and when Pizza woke up and saw me, he started freaking out. He was barking, howling, hissing, growling, making noises I'd never heard a dog make before. Grace and Sierra looked horrified, not at the dog but at ME. Grace came storming outside, Sierra didn't even bother to come to the door. Grace was so mad at me and berated me for doing that ""just to make a point"". I told her I didn't know what she was talking about and that I'd done nothing wrong. If anything, it was Sierra's fault for not training the dog appropriately.

Sierra texted me this morning to say that Pizza is now showing aggression to her brother again, despite making good progress in the last two weeks and that it was all my fault for scaring him like that. I don't think I did anything wrong and I think it's stupid that they're coddling the dog so much.",Asshole,150ciq7
"AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for getting pregnant knowing my wedding date? I have a best friend of 28+ years who offered to officiate and do hair for myself and other bridesmaids for my wedding, which has long been booked and paid for, invitations out, etc. Fast forward and she announces she’s pregnant, with her new boyfriend and her due date is 6 days after the wedding so she won’t be able to come period now. She has stated numerous times that this was a planned pregnancy and in my eyes I think its honestly hurtful and rude that she couldnt wait a couple of weeks (at most).

"AITA for pushing my husband to forgive my brother? My (35F) brother (33M) struggled with addiction since his late teens and I was directly impacted by his actions when I took him in at some point, and eventually discovered he stole from me and even from my husband (in his case, it was some of his own family heirlooms that also had huge sentimental value).

It was hard, but that’s hopefully in the past now. I am very proud to say that my brother was able to get the help he needed and he’s been clean for over a year. This weekend he came over to make amends to my husband and I (we sadly had to cut him out at some point). He apologized profusely and told us he wishes he can one day pay it back all he stole from us, but doesn’t have the means right now.

I told him we understand and we can come up with a payment plan in the future or find other ways he can make it up to us. But after my brother left, my husband was very upset with me because I spoke for him when I said “we understood”. He says he isn’t ready to forgive him, and I shouldn’t have implied to my brother that he was on the same page as I.

I told my husband that I was expecting him to have my back here and focus on helping on his healing process, which is more important than some material items. He is still upset.",Asshole,1bza28u
"AITA for making a joke about my wife's intelligence? My wife has an extremely big heart and cares for everyone around her. She always tends to see the absolute best in people, which leads to people taking advantage of her. She's been robbed because of her optimistic outlook on life. My wife is the timid type, never the confrontational type, and not the sharpest tool in the shed.

I have a very good friend whom I'm referring to as Stan for anonymity purposes. Stan and I have been friends for a very long time, and he is an extremely intelligent man, with a PhD and a professor at an esteemed university. When restrictions eased, Stan came to visit me.

My wife is very interested in Stan's line of work. When I introduced Stan to my wife, she began to ask him questions all related to his career. He answered them politely, but it felt more like an impromptu interview than two friends catching up when my wife was around.

I told my wife that her ""fascination"" with Stan's career could possibly be making him very uncomfortable. She apologized and promised to not ask questions and only speak when spoken to.

I invited Stan and his wife to a friendly dinner, and Stan's wife complimented my wife on her multilingualism, and my wife could not stop gushing about it when they left. She's very insecure in the presence of very intelligent people, and getting a compliment from an extremely intelligent person, especially a linguist, must have boosted her self-esteem.

I politely asked her to stop talking about my friends, but she started rambling about how someone saying ""you sound like a native"" is a very meaningful comment to her considering a bunch of other factors.

I made a harmless joke about why she's so surprised about someone complimenting her intelligence, is because she's not that intelligent. Instead of laughing along, she got offended, and I tried to explain myself by saying that no normal person would keep talking about one compliment that a stranger gave to them, and that I knew that she was obviously insecure being in the presence of very intelligent people, and the compliment is acting as ""compensation.""

She's very upset with me, and I've tried to have an adult conversation with her, but she's not listening to me. So, AITA?

She asked me if I could start helping during the night with the baby that way she isn't the only one not getting sleep. That is very unfair, I drive all day, I can't be expected to stay up at night then drive exhausted all day.  She thinks I'm being an asshole and inconsiderate, and has pretty much quit showing me any affection and only talks to me when she asks to shower or if I can watch the baby while she makes dinner.

"AITA for tossing out some cakes that my wife baked? I (38M) was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 2 months ago. It's completely self inflicted because of my lifestyle and weight,  and I completely acknowledge that. Since then though, I've been working hard to try and drop weight and make healthier choices, and I've started to make positive steps in that direction.

For me though, food is like an addiction, i don't want to compare it to more hardcore addictions like drugs or alcohol,  but I am constantly wanting to eat junk and treat food (which is how I got into this mess in the first place). I'm not going cold turkey on those foods (as I feel that's equally unrealistic), but I'm doing much better. My main strategy is trying not to buy it at all. Enter my wife.

She is not at all supportive in terms of trying to enable the healthy choices I'm trying to make. For example, she will continue to bring crisps and chocolate into the house in large amounts,  even though I ask her not to. I don't want her to flat out stop,  but it's an excessive amount. I know that the problem is mine and not hers, but it doesn't make it easier to have all this food temptation so close by.

She is also an amazing Baker - she will frequently try new recipies from TikTok and they are almost always incredible. Again though, I've asked her to maybe not make it all the time (like currently 2-3 times a week), but she's still doing it so frequently. 

Last night she made a tray bake of flapjacks, which are my absolute favourite. I had one, and not polishing off the tray required a huge mental effort from me (which I know, again is my fault).

This morning after she left for work (I work from home), I took the tray directly out to the bin and dumped the lot of them. It was a total impulse, and I felt bad about it, but I also sort of felt like a pressure had been lifted. When she came home, she was absolutely furious, but I tried to make my case and explain how hard it was to stop eating junk food after doing it for so long, and that I'd appreciate a little more support.  She's not talking to me now, and things are tense.

"AITA For mentioning my wife’s weight gain? I (31M) and my wife (32F) have been married for over 3 years, together for nearly 10. We have a child who is now nearly 2 years old. Obviously, during pregnancy there can be substantial weight gain, and I know it is difficult to lose baby weight. 

I have never previously said anything about her weight. I have explained that when she was ready to begin exercising again, to just let me know, and she can take as much time by herself as she needs. I had read it can take months or until a new mom is done breastfeeding before ready to exercise again. Here we are nearly a year after breastfeeding ending, and she snacks often and I’m noticing that she has put on more weight from this time a year ago, which was already a year post-partum. 

I had explained to her even before we were married that obesity was a rather large concern of mine. I shared concerns about my sister’s weight, and the effects on her overall health. I’ve stressed the importance of regular exercise and healthy eating. My wife used to teach exercise classes and worked out regularly. We have a child now, and both have full time jobs, so teaching classes as a hobby is no longer an option. 

I know people on here will think that she’s the mom, so she probably does everything around the house, and here is dad complaining about weight. We share duties, I work from home and do a lot of the household chores and cook most dinners. I try to cook very healthy dinners, but that’s ruined with her other meals and snacks. When I get a break, I exercise. When she gets a break, she lounges and snacks. She’s probably worked out twice in the last year, I had to spark it, and I don’t think she appreciated it.

I’ve since kept my mouth shut to see if things change, but nothing yet. I’m feeling this beginning to boil up in myself, and need to say something. Everyone says to just applaud efforts, rather than confront, but there has been nothing for me to applaud. Looking at recent pictures of us, all I’m beginning to see is weight gain and lack of self control. 

I’m scared a day is soon going to come when I can’t even say I’m attracted to my wife. I love her very much. She’s a great mom, great person, but an obese partner may not be something I can continue with, as shallow as I feel about it. Don’t mean to fat shame or anything, but I’ve made known was my perception for a long time. 

How should I broach the subject? Do I suggest exercise schedules? Point out her increasing weight gain? Mention the concerns this is casting to me in our future relationship? I sure feel like an a-hole, but I’m getting to the point where something needs to come from my mouth.

EDIT: There has been no medical eval to see if hormone issue. Suggesting that sounds just as bad to me, but seems to be the first recommendation. I have already mentioned healthier eating in the house. I stopped getting any of my previous junk foods to help show I meant it, but she still gets hers.  I stopped getting frozen pizza and pastas, she still gets hers. She hasn’t stepped on a scale in months. If I had to guess, maybe she lost about 10lbs of baby weight in the first year, and has since put on 30+lbs in year 2. So maybe like 50lbs over pre-baby weight. She may want a second child, but I wouldn’t want to at this trajectory.

EDIT2: There have been a couple of instances where she says she needs to exercise, and may create an exercise schedule for the week. Then just doesn’t. When I try to remind her what she said, she get’s irritated like I’m the bad guy for asking.

FINAL EDIT: Thank you to those who were able to understand where I was coming from, and could sense the love I have for my family. Thanks to others for criticism that was CONSTRUCTIVE, even if you couldn’t see where I was coming from. Plenty of comments were not helpful whatsoever, but I know where I posted, so to be expected. Ultimately, this is a conversation we are going to have. I believe my wife would share something with me that was troubling her about myself, even if she knew it would be tough for me to hear. Tough conversations are a huge part of marriage after all. This is still a health issue in my mind, whether physical or mental. I have taken away much from this post, and will approach this conversation very gently, with my intent being that we are there for our child as long as humanly possible. There seem to be a good many of you who don’t understand or don’t care about medical issues caused by unhealthy eating/sedentary lifestyle choices…maybe look into it yourself if you want to live a long healthy life (IATA).",Asshole,175g2yw
"AITA for threatening to call the RA on my roommate when she brought a cat into the place? I (21F) am currently in my junior year of college. For the upperclassmen, my university has a couple of options, one being a kind of duplex/townhome type of situation. There’s 2 bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms that house 2 students apiece and then a common area with a full kitchen. It’s a little more expensive, but it’s better than living in the dorms and cheaper than living off campus. Anyway, I have 3 new roommates this year: Jen, Veronica, and Opal, all around my age or a little older (all fake names). I share a room with Opal, with Jen and Veronica in the other. I get along well with Jen and Opal. Veronica and I aren’t enemies, but we’re also not super close. I can tell she doesn’t necessarily like me, but she’s never been mean or anything, so I let it go.

In my city, there is a large stray cat problem. Even when I was living in the regular dorms, it wasn’t unusual to be walking back from class and find a few just hanging out. I don’t like cats. I’m not allergic, I’m just also not a fan. Veronica, on the other hand, has a bleeding heart for animals. She apparently has a reputation around campus for bringing the strays she can catch to local clinics that will spay/neuter and give vaccinations for free. She also tries to find no-kill shelters or people willing to foster/adopt any cats who willingly come. We have a small yard behind our duplex and I know she leaves food for them. This is annoying to me, but it’s not against housing rules. The only thing housing doesn’t allow is animals of any kind inside, unless it’s a registered service animal. Until recently, Veronica didn’t break that rule so I bit my tongue. I know she’s not the only student to do this, so the cats do have regular food provided throughout the year and won’t go without if Veronica isn’t there.

Yesterday, I’m watching TV in the common area when Veronica walks in. She leaves the door propped open and I remind her to close it. She says she’s going to feed “the babies”, aka the cats. Whatever. Then, I see a cat walk in. I immeadiately get up and start saying “shoo, shoo”. Veronica rolls her eyes and tells me to relax, this is Winston, one of the cats she’s taken to be neutered and vaccinated, he’s harmless. I say I don’t want him in there. She says it’s going to be 2 seconds until she can get the food. I tell her either she takes the cat out or I’m calling the RA and reporting her for bringing a cat in here. She blinked a couple of times, muttered an apology and went outside with Winston. When she came back in, she was thankfully alone, and just went to her room. She hasn’t spoken to me since. Jen and Opal have told me that I majorly overreacted to the situation. They say since Veronica wasn’t trying to keep Winston there, it was just a couple of seconds until she got the food, etc. I said it doesn’t matter. They told me this is “my problem” and I need to be less “stuck up”. Am I being an ass here?",Asshole,1oejx6o
"AITA for refusing to call my friends baby by his first name when she named him after my ex? So one of my (25F) closest friends (24F) and her boyfriend (25M) recently welcomed a baby boy. Out of all the names they could have landed on, they decided to name him Luca, after my ex, Luke. Luke and I broke up several months ago and it wasn't an amicable end to the relationship. However, Luke and my friends bf (Ben) are best friends and workmates, and they used to live together before Ben moved in with his gf, so they're extremely close. Apparently close enough for Ben to suggest naming his son after him. 

My friend knows our relationship didn't end well, so I was pretty hurt when I found out she was honouring him by naming her son after him. She told me that Luca was a name she'd loved forever, and that Luke is someone who is a really important part of Ben's life so the name just made sense. I don't understand why they couldn't honour any other male in either of their lives, such as their fathers or brothers, or even just use Luca as a middle name, but I can't change their opinions so whatever. 

I don't want to be reminded of my ex every time I see my friend's baby, so instead I decide to call him Jamie whenever I'm playing with him, from his middle name, James. I even made him a blanket embroided with that nickname. I don't see a problem, because I think it's perfectly normal for people to have nicknames that are only used by one person. Even for myself, my uncle has his own nickname for me that no one else uses. But my friend got upset when she saw the blanket and heard me addressing him by that name, saying it was childish and disrespectful and it was erasing part of her son's identity. 

I asked her what she expected from me after naming her son after my ex, and she told me that I was being self-centred and that just because I had a bad relationship with Luke, doesn't mean she or Ben did, so I can't expect her to take into account my feelings with everything related to her son. 

I think that not naming her son after a person who I just ended a long term relationship with is not a farfetched request at all, and her violating that request is just an invitation for me to address her son by whatever nickname I choose.

Also it's worth noting that Me and Luke where together before her and Ben were, so it's not like she had known Luke for a long period of time or had any sort of relationship or interactions with him before I started dating him.

"AITA for wanting my best friend (and MOH) at my wedding even though it’s her birthday? I (22F) am getting married to my fiancee (29M) next year. Our wedding isn’t going to be super extravagant, as we only wanted to celebrate with our friends and family. A lot of the things for our wedding are going to be simple, DIY, with the help of our friends/family, etc. The main thing we absolutely wanted was our wedding venue. We instantly knew it was the one and we wanted a specific date ( our 3 year first date anniversary). Unfortunately, our venue told us this date was not available and so we chose a date a few weeks after. It was around this time that we announced our wedding party.

Flash forward to about 2 weeks ago when we got a call from our venue saying that the date we originally wanted had opened up. We were thrilled so we moved our wedding back. We didn’t have any reservations about doing this because everyone who was coming to the wedding is relatively local and hadn’t made any travel accommodations yet. We told our guests about the change and everyone was fine until I got a call from my best friend and maid of honor. 

She said that the wedding was now her birthday (which I obviously knew) and that her and her boyfriend were going to go on a trip that week. I was shocked as I hadn’t heard of these plans before, but I just told her that I really wanted her to be at my wedding because she is my best friend in the world. She told me it was unfortunate that the wedding date moved, but that her trip was already paid for and mostly non-refundable. I was crying at this point, and just said how this is unfair and how upset I am. She said I didn’t have a reason to be this upset because I moved the date without telling anyone and someone was bound to not be able to go  anymore. Some words were exchanged then (basically us going back and forth and bringing up old conflicts) and she hung up on me.

"AITA for telling my sister she can't get a 'discount' to buy our parents' house? My sister (F56) has been living with our mother for the past 5 years since our dad died and covid hit. Mom's dementia meant she shouldn't be alone, and sis &amp; her son (12 yo) offered to move in to mom's house.

Now that mom needs to move to long term care, we can sell her house. Sis wants to buy it for herself and her son, and she wants it at a lower price than we'd get from the market. I've refused and think I might be the AH. 



Sis has taken care of my mother for the last few years, doing the shopping, cooking, meds, appointments, etc but she's been getting free rent so it seems like she's already benefited with free housing. I admit I don't do much for my mom - I live an hour away and I take night school courses. Plus I'm not as patient and can't handle some of her habits brought on by the dementia.



We don't know what the house is really worth, because it's run down and needs a ton of work, and all the other houses around have been renovated. My sister thinks that this house being run down will put it closer to her price range. For context, neighborhood houses have sold recently for about $1.2-$1.5 million, and she wants to buy this house for $1 M-$1.2 million. A real estate agent recently said he thought could get close to $1.5 M. I've got another agent coming today and I told sis she'll have to pay full price if she wants it. (She owns an investment rental she could sell, and I own my own home.) My sis called me an AH for ruining her chances at home ownership and for not stepping up with help.  Also for context, it's rare to find a house in our city under $1 M.



My mother can afford a nursing home so she doesn't need the money from the sale of the house to live on, but the less my mother spends, the more we inherit when she passes away. And our parents always wanted things divided equally among us.

We have 2 kids who were 10 and 12 when they lost their mother. I met my current partner not long afterwards when we were introduced by a mutual friend. She was very supportive and so helpful with the kids, especially my daughter who was entering her teenage years. The kids and I absolutely adore her. Before we got together, she was with her ex for 12 years but they were never married. They had a lot of conflict in the final years and finally broke up a month before their daughter was born. He's never made a legal claim to the daughter and is not present in her life. Since getting together, I treat the daughter as my own and plan to adopt her when we eventually get married. She plans to adopt my kids.

During my partner's relationship with her ex, the ex gave her a very expensive diamond ring. She's very fond of the ring and it's prominent in a lot of old photos. She never explained the meaning of the ring but I suspect it was supposed to be a substitute for a wedding ring and symbolise some sort of eternal devotion. I asked her why she would want to keep a symbol of an ex she's no longer in a relationship with. She responded by asking me why I'm keeping the wedding rings with my late wife. I told her that late spouses are on a different level to an ex boyfriend. She disagrees.

"AITA for asking my stepdaughter to please pick her brother up from school? A year ago, my stepdaughter (19F) came to live with me, her father, and her half brother (9M). SD came with a lot of mental issues rooting from her treatment from her mother during school. She has been a mess since she moved with us and admittedly it was not the best circumstance and she claims that she's improving, even though I'm not sure that I see it. She had a hospital stay about a year ago and has been in intensive expensive therapy since.  
  
SD goes to school and works at her school but she has very few hours and is not taking a full load. Since she moved in, she's had some responsibilities around the house. One of those responsibilities is picking her brother up from school and watching him  and driving him to activities. She complains about this, so I think you'll understand why I think she's being a bit dramatic.  
  
SD's medication was recently changed. She was placed on a medication that was supposed to eliminate her nightmares and allow her to sleep. I don't know how severe they are, but today was her first day on them.   
  
At noon, I found her asleep on the couch. Naps typically aren't allowed, especially on a weekday when she needs to be doing coursework and chores. I woke her up and she claimed that she was ""out of it"" and ""couldn't stay awake"". I reminded her of our rule and encouraged her to be productive. I thought all was well until I asked her to pick her brother up.  
  
About 10 minutes after she left the house, my husband came running in panicking because he'd discovered her laying dazed on the ground after allegedly passing out in the lawn. Honestly, I was suspicious. She's very dramatic a lot of the time and a hypochondriac. When I asked her what she was doing, she babbled about the medication also apparently being a BP lowering medication and she'd passed out from that. Her BP is often low, but I don't see how this could've caused something like that. I think she's just trying to get out of picking her brother up but now my husband is mad at me.

"AITA for telling a colleague to socialize more because she keeps to herself, which then led her to have an attitude? 
We've been working together for the past year. I know her routine like clockwork. I'm usually at work before her, but when she arrives, she greets everyone in the cafeteria and then goes straight to her workplace. She won't sit with everyone until the workday begins. As soon as she gets on site, she heads to her workspace and waits until it's time to start working. During lunch, she also won't sit with anyone; she waits until there are only a few people left and then has lunch by herself. In meetings, she doesn't talk much or give input, whereas everyone else in the team does.

Now, I'm not saying she's quiet and awkward by any means. She will occasionally sit with us, talk, and joke, but only for short periods. Last week, we had a meeting/training session, and she finally said something because the trainer asked everyone around the table for their input. This shocked me, and when the training was done, I was walking behind her as she talked to other people. I jokingly told her, ""Finally, you said something,"" and she turned around and sarcastically replied, ""I give input where it's needed. I don't just say things for the sake of it or repeat what five other people have already said in different words."" I was taken aback by her attitude.",Asshole,1dy6szw

He played it anyway so I tried to pay attention, but kept wanting to tune out, read the book to the baby, check my phone, get up and go to the kitchen, talk about other things, etc.  I was forcing my attention back to it.  He was fast forwarding and explaining what he had fast forwarded (in an attempt to make it shorter for me) and after about 2 minutes of that he looked over and I said this is painful. 

He got upset at that, turned it off, and said that anybody should be able to watch a five minute video.  I took offense to that because it felt like he was commenting on my attention span knowing full well I CAN watch a 5 minute video.  I gave the baby back and left the room, and went outside to smoke. 

I came back in mentally prepared to watch the video and asked him to put it back on as an olive branch and he said no.  I said your way or the highway huh?  He said it was fine for him not to share it because I said it was painful.  I explained I was trying to offer an olive branch and recapped that I had said it was long, he said that's why he fast forwarded.  He also doesn't understand why I took offense to the 5 minute comment.  

I didn't think saying it was painful was complaining a ton, and I was really trying to offer the olive branch by mentally preparing and asking to watch it.  He doesn't think he did anything wrong and that I suck for not being into it right when he wanted to show me.  

I get it, it's just 5 minutes, but also it's full attention on a mentalist video on YouTube when that 5 minutes is 1/6 of the remaining time and there's a baby wanting my attention.  We wasted all the rest of the time before kids got home talking about it.

"AITA because I (38F) don't want to take my stepson (9) on vacation? My husband (39) and I have been married for 5 years. We have two children of our own, both girls, aged 5 and 2. I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed.

My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted ""a fresh start"" so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody.

I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable.

My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH:

1. My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).
2. She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got.

If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH?

UPDATE:

We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.  


After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.  
  
I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being ""yours"". I don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that. As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change.

So I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.

"AITA for having less time for my kids? I’m a 35m and the mother of my children Lexi is also 35. We had an extremely healthy breakup (we were never married) so we had an agreement for me to see our kids(16f, 15m,10) every other weekend but they could also stay with me whenever they wanted to. 

However right now I’m living with my partner Lana and I’m taking care of my stepkids (9m,6f,4m) and she is also expecting so I have to prioritise them at the moment. This weekend was supposed to be the weekend for me to see the kids however I had to cancel as Lana is extremely stressed and didn’t want more people in the house so I obliged, I called Lexi to tell her they can’t come over and she said she would let the kids know. My 16-year-old called me to let me know she was disappointed and she missed me because I had to cancel last time as well I explained to her that Lana was struggling and I needed to be there for her and the kids, she got really upset saying that I love Lana and her kids more than her. I told her that that wasn’t true and I love Lana and her kids as much as I love my biological children. I told her that I could go to lunch with all of them and then go shopping and catch up, they all agreed and we had a great time up until Lana called me and told me she was feeling sick so I had to leave early and head home so Lana could rest.

"AITA for not sending my kids back to the US to finish their school? I (54F) and my kids (17M and 16M) came on vacation to Chad (a country in Africa) a year ago, telling them that we will be on vacation, but before school started I made the decision to stay there because I wanted a better life for myself because I was miserable in the US, but I didn't tell them this. What I did tell them is that they will be staying here, and that is a week before school started. Since then, we have been getting into constant fights about the school they have been going to, which they don't like because it didn't offer the same opportunities as they school they went to back in the US, but I think it is better for them because it offers the ability to graduate early, but they don't want to graduate early either.

Two weeks ago I got into a fight with the kids when both of them asked me to go back to the United States for their extracurriculars and advanced classes and I told them to ask their dad. They told me that he is not the one who decides; I am. After a few minutes of back and forth, I called a relative to pick them up.

But what happened today is what really stressed me out, as this argument was worse than the one a few weeks ago. For a few weeks now, I have been doing their renewal of their expired passports so I can send them back to do their school in the US. Today, their passports came back to me, and my kids asked me if they can go back now. I told them that I have changed my mind and that they will not be going back to the US to finish up their school because I have a job here and my life and that I have asked my cousin to go and she said she wasn't able to. Both of my kids exploded on me, telling me I have every reason to drop everything and go back to the US with them, and that their education, happiness, and opportunities are more important than my happiness. I told them that while they may be upset now, they will thank me later when they realized that they have a big family here, lots of cousins and they can build better relationships here. They told me that I don't care about them at all and that the only thing I cared about is filling up my ""delusional"" dream of a perfect child because I am so obsessed with the idea of them finishing high school here early when they don't want to, and that both of my kids had their important years at school (youngest is a junior while eldest is a senior) and that I am going to succeed in ruining those years for them because I only cared about myself and my needs. They then called me an asshole for not sending them back and lying to them about sending them back and they stormed off into their room. This time I didn't call a relative for this.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend that getting his sister’s name tattooed behind his ear is weird? Me and my boyfriend have been together for a while and his family is very close and connected. My family is the opposite we fight a lot but still take care of each other. He recently told me that he wanted to get a tattoo of his sister’s name behind his ear in Japanese. Now let me say this, I AM NOT against him getting his sister’s name tattooed I just felt that the placement he chose was weird for it to be his sister. He asked me what my opinion was, but I could see that my disagreement had hurt his feelings AITA?


EDIT: The reason I consider that placement weird is because we are from different places and raised differently. He is from the south and I’m from the north, Tattoos placed behind the ear are more often used for your kids names or your partner’s name where I’m from.

EDIT2: I am not telling him nor have I told him not to get the tattoo, he has free will to do what he wants. I just expressed how I felt about it when he asked .",Asshole,1kjd24g
"AITA for not wanting my autistic cousin at my child-free wedding? Throwaway because I have family that use Reddit as well. Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don’t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call “high-functioning”, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don’t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it’s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I’ve met before, but I really don’t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn’t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an “adult”, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she’d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn’t want to hear it.

"AITA for not standing up for my boyfriend after the “demeaning” comment my aunt made? I honestly don’t think this is even a big deal but my boyfriend is being very sensitive about it, so I guess I want an outside opinion. 

We were at my grandparents’ house for dinner yesterday. My boyfriend has met my parents and grandparents but this was the first time that he met my extended family. It was all going very well until my aunt started asking my boyfriend questions. 

For context: We’re from very different backgrounds. I’m currently in uni and he is working as a security guard. We actually met because he was working private security for a friend of mine and he recently switched over to working at a museum. I’m 23 and he’s 28.

He’s a very sweet man and the first relationship where I didn’t feel like I’d have to put on an act for my partner. I think it might have something to do with his working-class upbringing and it’s one of the things I adore about him.

My aunt asked him normal questions (about his family, where he went to school, what he does for a living, etc.) that he didn’t seem to have a problem with answering them. When he told her about his job she asked if that’s what he wants to do for the rest of his life or if he’s planning on getting a serious career. He told her that he likes his job and doesn’t plan on changing it any time soon.

She then looked at the both of us and made a comment along the lines of “it’s a good thing your finances are separate then”. My father ended up changing the topic and I thought that was it. My aunt can be a bit direct and doesn’t always filter her words so sometimes she makes comments like this but they shouldn’ be taken too seriously.

My boyfriend was quiet for the rest of the meal and didn’t say much on the way home either. When we got  to my place I asked him why he was acting like this and he said that my aunt’s comments were hurtful and that he wished I had said something. I told him that it’s not a big deal and that’s just how she can be and that he shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. I told him that if he ever does want to change his job though, I could talk to one of mine or my dad’s friends. He said he didn’t want that and that was the end of it for me.

I texted him this morning if he wanted to come over later but he said he was busy this weekend. I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t answer me. I honestly think this behavior is childish and very unfair towards me.


Edit: my boyfriend (not ex) called me back and asked if I had time. He'll be coming by in an hour or so. I agree that it might have been bad timing of me to mention my father's contacts but it wasn't meant to belittle him. Depending on his mood I'll try to explain my thoughts to him again


Update: My boyfriend (still not my ex) came over last night. We talked about what happened. I apologized for not taking him seriously enough and he apologized for blowing things out of proportions over one comment. He agreed that at some point in the future (maybe once we have kids) he'd like a less stressful job but right now he doesn't want to. Neither of us even mentioned breaking up so you can all calm down. He's actually in the kitchen making breakfast right now. I hope you all have a nice sunday :)",Asshole,17syur1
"AITA for telling my girlfriend to keep her nose out of my friend’s business? One of my older friends (he’s 26 now, turning 27 in a few months, rest of our friend group is 20-22), Sam, is planning to come with our friend group to our skiing lodge trip over winter break between semesters. This last trip is very important to him, his wife is having a baby and it’s not likely he’ll be able to continue to go even though we plan to continue it after we all graduate. Now keep in mind the due date actually isn’t even 2 days until after he would be getting back, not that it matters because their marital affairs are literally none of our business. 

As you can imagine his wife is upset with him over this. That’d be fine except my girlfriend has become friends with the wife so now I also have to hear about how wrong it is for him to be leaving during this time. Sam approached me and my other friend about the rude comments our girlfriends have made towards him about him “abandoning” his wife, and I’ve apologized profusely for her behavior and told him I’d address it.

I told my girlfriend that she was out of line, that how Sam wishes to handle his domestic affairs is up to him, and that she needs to keep her nose out of it. I told her it was totally unacceptable how she was butting into their affairs, even if nominally doing so to defend the wife. She said that I’m not in control of her, she’s free to speak her mind, and I can’t tell her what to do. I rightly said that she can’t tell my friend what to do either, and that there’s a certain amount of expectable tact from a partner and that it was totally unfair of her to be hostile to a close friend of mine thus putting me in an embarrassing situation like she has done.

"AITA for telling my daughter that her mental illness shouldn't be used as an excuse? For the past several years, my daughter has been dealing with anxiety.  She has been seeing a therapist, taking medication, eating well, and exercising regularly.  She has had periodic meltdowns, but for the most part this has been enough.  However, in the past year at college, she has been struggling to adapt to living in the dorms.  Her last semester's grades took a dive, and it seems like all the responsibility is greatly stressing her out.  I was under the impression that this anxiety was only a phase and that she would outgrow it eventually, but it seems to have only worsened after she turned 18.

To make matters worse, my daughter hasn't yet gotten a summer job, and I think her nervousness is making her seem weird during interviews.  With each rejection email, I'd gotten more and more frustrated with her therapists.  I was starting to be convinced that they have been refusing to help her for years, since the longer she has anxiety, the more they get paid.  However, my brother, who has a psychological background, told me that it's common for anxiety to get worse during early adulthood and that her therapists are likely doing all they can.  I decided that he was probably right, and I stopped thinking about it.  I think I deserve quite a bit of credit for that.  Today, however, my daughter came home from an interview, telling me that it didn't go well, and I had enough.  I told her that she was going to have to at least make an effort to be normal and that staring at someone's shoes, rather than making eye contact, would never get her a job.

My daughter was taken aback by my frankness, but I just kept going.  I told her that if she thinks she will be able to finish college without putting forth much effort, she was sadly mistaken, and that obtaining a degree is going to help her live a decent life on her own when she finally moves out of my house.  She began to tear up and told me that I was being unfair, but I chuckled and told her that life isn't fair and that she needs to learn some social skills or she would almost certainly end up homeless.  The thing that infuriates me is that she can look my wife and I in the eyes as she's telling us these sob stories, but she decides not to make these same connections with prospective employers.  I told her that she needs to maybe go take a walk and think about how her actions were screwing things up for her, but instead she stormed off to her bedroom and slammed the door shut.

She hasn't come out for several hours, and I'm worried that her delusional thinking (that she will just be handed a degree or a career) is never going to end.  I tried sliding a list of tips for making a good impression during an interview under her door, but I heard her get up and tear them up. I'm at the point now where I just want to kick her out of my house, but my wife insists that I'm being too hard on her.

"AITA for telling my son to let my younger son to hangout with him and his friends for clout? My 13yo son Chase is pretty popular, good-looking, smart, athletic and has a lot of friends. His teachers and his friends' parents all like him and he doesn't cause much trouble for me or my ex wife.

I also have an 11yo Ash who doesn't have that same level of confidence and has a few friends but gets points for being Chase's younger brother. I think it would behoove Ash to hangout with Chase and his friends so he can get a little clout and learn to be a bit more social and gain confidence.

Chase is having a few friends over this weekend and I suggested they invite Ash to join them in whatever they do which will likely be playing video games and eating. Chase said no because he didn't want Ash there. I said at least let him sleep with you all and he said no.

"AITA for not letting my bf use my bathroom? I 22F graduated college a couple years ago and have been working in finance. My salary affords me a nice apartment. My bf “Tom” 21M is a senior in college who struggles to pay living expenses because he receives no support from family. A few months ago I invited him to live with me so he wouldn’t have to pay for housing. He hesitated at first but I assured him that I was happy to take the next step in our relationship. Plus, once he graduated he would be able to pay rent too. I only had one condition: he is not allowed to use my bathroom connected to the master bedroom, and instead has to use the guest bathroom only. I did not tell him this, but the reason is because I have severe IBS and other bowel problems. I know I will have to open up about this eventually, but for now I need my bathroom to be a completely private space.   
	For the first couple of months, everything went smoothly. Tom is a model roommate. He does his dishes literally the second he finishes eating, insists on doing both of our laundry, and cleans the entire apartment every week. He’s quiet except for when he plays an instrument, and he checks with me before he has guests. Even though he doesn’t have much money, he’s always doing little things to brighten my day. He makes sure the vase on my dining table always has flowers in it, and often brings home takeout for me, without thinking to buy any for himself. Tom is such a selfless person, so I feel really bad about our argument last night.  
	Tom woke up in the middle of the night last night to pee. I had just woken up to see he had already peed in the master bathroom. I asked why he couldn’t use the guest bathroom and he said he was worried he would pee his pants if he had to go down the hall. I told him he is an ADULT and he should be able to hold it. He asked why it was such a big deal and went on to remind me how great of a house guest he is. I told him I did not care about all of that stuff. I let him live rent free in my apartment and the only thing I asked him was to not use my bathroom. He was like whatever and he slept in the guest room the rest of the night. He went to campus early this morning to do work in his lab and has not come back yet, even though we always go on a Saturday afternoon hike together.   
	I am worried that I have damaged my relationship with Tom. My mom says I overreacted and that maybe it is time to apologize and let him know why I don’t let him use the bathroom. I realize to an outsider it may seem that I'm being an AH, but Tom also really broke my trust by using the bathroom. Should I have been gentler with him? Should I start letting him use my bathroom?

"AITA for getting a fellow service dog handler kicked out of a store? Ok so for context I am a service dog handler Ray and I have been a team for 3 years since she was 8 weeks old.  She currently knows 83 commands 33 of those being tasks that help with my autism and a fainting disorder. We live in Canada meaning that while Ray is fully trained legally she is considered in training as we haven't taken a public access test due to her not being fixed yet (a requirement). Now with those out of the way here's my dilemma. We were minding our business shopping in a Dollarama and we hear this dog absolutely flipping out. I told Ray to find my mom and we came across this lady in a wheelchair pinning a dog to her lap that was actively trying to wiggle out of her grasp I asked her what it was for and she said seizures and i said mine was for autism and I tried to be well meaning and tell the lady hey I see you have a in training dog too it seems to be not ready for public access in a non pet friendly place there is a pet store next door that might work better to build their confidence. Ray was kinda just chilling looking between me and the dog so once said lady got offended we walked off waited a few then reported her to a manager and got her kicked out. That was my first interaction with a wheelchaired handler and I'm not sure if I handled it correctly so the question is AITA for getting her kicked out since her dog was causing a ruckus?


EDIT: I see I may have to clarify some things. I am autistic meaning that I don't process social interactions the same way as most. My default is help then get help. I tried to help with a suggestion ans then got help which resulted in this individual getting kicked out.
The person I was in conflict with was in a wheelchair. Ergo the old invisible vs visible disability debate. This is my way of letting people analyze a situation from a 3rd party and finding ways to improve further situations. The dog in question was lunging and barking at my dog so I got her kicked out. Dollarama is a non pet friendly store hence service dogs. Service dogs are allowed in all stores due to being classified as medical equipment. They are far from pets and usually go through intensive training a pet dog wouldn't even dream of. If a service dog trained or otherwise is causing a scene that doesn't aid the handler in a positive purpose they legally can be asked to leave. I also may need to add that although I am 18 I function at a 10-13 year olds level which sometimes comes across as offensive I also tend to offer advice instead of asking questions which I am working on. 

EDIT: Ray was just spayed today (October 3rd) for everyone who was concerned. She did well and is recovering nicely and will be back to work in 2-3 weeks after crate rest.",Not the A-hole,1nc8kw1
"AITA for making my daughter to redo his book reports for the summer because he used audiobooks instead of reading them Mistyped my title: AITA for making my daughter redo her book reports for the summer because she used audiobooks instead of reading them

Sorry on phone

Reading comprehension and listening comprehension are two different things

My daughter is in middle school, and over the summer, the kids are given a list to choose some books to read and answer questions. These ""book reports"" (it's more of a package and essay with questions about the book) are due the first day back at school. It's just a summer reading assignment they have to complete. Sara has to read two books from the ten-book list and fill out the corresponding book report.

I was impressed that she had already filled out one of the packages, and she claimed she was in the middle of the other book.  Reading has never been her strongest subject. Yesterday I learned she was not reading the book; instead, she found the audiobooks online and was listening to them. That defeats the purpose of practicing reading skills; reading and listening are completely different things.

I informed her that she needs to pick out two different books from the list, and she will need to read them. I will be monitoring her phone more closely and she will join me for 30 mins every day to just read. I will also be reading during that time. She was not happy about this.

Today was our first reading session. Sara was very unhappy and my husband and I got into an argument after. He thinks I am being a jerk, and she was able to fill out the packages so what is the problem? I told him that being able to fill out the package isn't the point; the point is to practice reading comprehension. Not listening. Especially since reading is a subject she has trouble with.  I love audiobooks (I usually listen to one going to work), but they are not reading, it's a different skill.

He thinks I am being unfair and a jerk, we are at a standstill on this and want more opinions. Am i being a jerk about this.

Edit: She doesn't have dyslexia,  she was tested, the teacher recommended that to everyone who was in the lower reading group, and we listened to her. She just struggles with this subject. Some kids struggle in math or history. She struggles in reading",Not the A-hole,1lfnvjh

Frank is a widower with a teenage daughter named Leanne (F16) of his own. We were able to bond quickly because of our many similarities and a few months ago Frank proposed; we're getting married in the summer. 

However, this hasn't been entirely smooth sailing. While Leanne accepted me quickly and tries to get along with Beth, Beth has been another story. For one, she's openly rude to Frank, refusing to do anything he tells her to and frequently referring to him as a creep to her friends because of the age difference. She also treats Leanne with contempt, to the point of leaving a room if she's in the room and ignoring her when she tries to talk to her. She only met Leanne and Frank after I got engaged to Frank, so at first I figured it was normal for her to be a little hostile at first, but it's persisted over the last few months and has gotten even worse. So the other day I pulled her aside and told her that I didn't care what she thought of Frank and Leanne, that she was going to begin treating them with respect from here on out and that was final. Beth then stormed off and spent a few hours with a friend, and has been chilly to me since.",Asshole,1avw9mh
"AITA for “pranking” my bf’s dad and being “disrespectful?” We’re in college but we were back home for the weekend and staying at my bf’s house.

On Sunday, we had a girls night. I’m really close to his sister and we had multiple female friends come over.

It wasn’t weird for my bf because we live next to his grandparents and his male cousins were over, so he spent the night hanging out with them. But he was still right next door the entire night.

We got drunk and started talking about my bf’s dad, who is a really attractive man. He’s in his mid-forties, but he doesn’t look like he’s in his mid-forties. He gives off I-don’t-age-vibes like Henry Calvin.

But it’s hilarious because multiple of our friends have crushes on him and talk about how hot he is. It’s all in good fun, of course, because he’s married and also 20+ years older.

But we were playing truth and dare and one of our friends dared our other friend to give my bf’s dad a letter saying, “I wish I were your wife because you hot hot hot.” Which at the time had us dying in laughter.

We went downstairs and gave him the letter. He thanked us and said he would read it later and we immediately run back upstairs.

That’s when it was my turn and I picked dare. My dare was to ask my bf’s dad if he wears boxers or briefs. I was like… guys, I cannot do that. But they said I had to.

They talked me up to do it and embarrassingly I went downstairs and asked him. I said, “Mr-Name, do you wear boxers or briefs? My friends and I need to know.”

He didn’t answer the question. But you could tell he was frustrated. He said, “you young ladies need to get upstairs and keep it down. You’re going to wake up my wife. We have work in the morning. Time to head off to bed.”

Super anti-climactic.

I woke up to my bf, packing our stuff and getting ready to leave. I asked him what was up and he said, “nothing with me, but it looks like YOU had lots of fun.”

It was said so rudely. I said you knew we were getting drunk. What is your deal?

He said you embarrassed me in front of my dad, in front of my family, asking questions like that. It comes off super trashy and gross. I don’t know what the fuck you were thinking.

I said wow, calm down. It’s not a big deal. Don’t call me trashy, wtf. I was dared to do it, I had to do it, and your sister was there. She could have stopped me.

He said the most annoying thing which was, “If your friends tell you to jump of a bridge, you gonna do that too?”

I was so annoyed and HUNGOVER and didn’t even bother responding. I felt like it was so rude that he was attacking me when I was drunk. What happened was no big deal, and his dad didn’t even respond to it.

He has been ignoring me, which is also annoying. We had multiple exams so I haven’t been paying that much attention, but he hasn’t been responding to my texts. I feel like he is way overreacting.

"AITA for telling my friend she's a major c*ckblock? On Saturday I (29M) went to a friend's wedding. I asked my good friend Kate (29F) if she could give me a ride since I'm only about 10-15 minutes away from her and didn't want to spend a ton of money on an uber to the other end of town where the venue was. She said no problem.

Now for context, we've been good friends for about a decade, and this was one of our mutual friends getting married from our friend group. I'm the only one in our friend circle who smokes, so I would occasionally step outside for a cigarette throughout the evening. At one point a girl who was working at the venue was also outside on a smoke break herself, and we started chatting and got along really well. After about 5 minutes she had to head back in to get back to work.

I started to immediately kick myself for not getting her number because I thought we hit it off. I kept an eye out for her in the hall but I didn't see her again. When the night was wrapping up, Kate and I started to head back to her car, which was about a 5 minute walk away. I couldn't stop thinking about finding this girl, so I told Kate to go ahead because I was going to have one more smoke and I'll catch up. She said it's ok she can wait with me. I told her again it's cool, go ahead, but she said she didn't mind.

We started walking again and about a minute later I clutched my stomach and said I need a minute and I'll see her at her car. She became concerned and asked if I was ok and basically wouldn't go ahead without me because she thought I was going to be sick or something. After AGAIN not going ahead when I asked her to I grumbled that I'm fine and we walked the rest of the way to her car.

Once we got in the car I snapped at her for not being able to take a hint. She was really confused and I explained that I wanted to go find a girl I was chatting with earlier to give her my number, and why couldn't she go to the car like I asked so I could go back and find her quickly. She said she had no idea that's what I was trying to do and to go back now and she'll wait for me. I said it's pointless now because she came outside with some garbage and saw us walking together so she's going to assume I have a gf. Kate said she'll come with me to clear up that we're just friends and I said to forget and told her she's a huge c\*ckblock for not taking a hint.

The car ride home was complete silence, and when I got home I started ranting to my roommate about what happened. He thinks I'm over reacting, but I feel like ANYONE could have figured out I was trying to give them a hint MULTIPLE times. She cost me a chance at a girl I really hit it off with. AITA??

EDIT: OK, so clearly people think I'm the AH. I do understand that she wasn't blocking me intentionally, but I felt like it was so painfully obvious that I wanted to be left alone for a few minutes and was incredibly frustrated that she wouldn't take the hint. I just shot her a text thanking her for the ride on Saturday and that I appreciate her friendship.",Asshole,16a89ky

for background info, i never got along with this girl, and shes kinda the hot cheeto girl that i find very obnoxious (ive had a history with getting into arguments with her since 8th grade) but anyways. 

I lost my temper and said ""you dont have to be such a bitch"" and then we got into an argument. eventually, my teacher got involved because she could hear us arguing. she then starts calling me a racist and a weirdo, and started making ship up. 

eventually, we were both pulled into the hallway, and rven then we still kept arguing when the teacher was trying to mediate. eventually, i apologuzed for calling her a bitch, but she hasnt apologized at all. 

the teacher wrote a referral for me, and idk what she did with the other girl.

"AITA not finding my friends comment to his mom funny? UPDATE:

So the general consensus is I’m not the asshole for not finding it funny, but his joke to his mum was okay if his mum found it ok, and I understand as is she did, so I’m gonna let it go. 

I also understand that if someone said it while spewing women hatred, or said it to me - I am allowed to shut that shit down, but in this case, it was banter within the family and humour is subjective so there no more to it than that. 

Thanks everyone for explaining this to me in a straight forward way, and not shitting on my autism. You’re the best ❤️

———————————————————————————————

Long story short, we’re both autistic (former called Asperger’s), he’s a white straight man 31, I’m a brown bi woman 32.

He was calling me, talking about his father having a conversation with a colleague who’s having an oopsie-baby when their children are grown, and the colleague was wondering in a joking manner if they wanted one too (my friend is 31, and his younger brother is 25)

He was speaking with his parents about it and wanted to egg his mom on and said “well someone is past their expiration date aren’t they?” And his mother squinted and said “the hell I am”

Personally I dint find it very funny as women has been tied to their ability to bear children for decades. In the work place we’re discriminated for when we have children, if we want a career we are bad mothers, if we don’t want children we aren’t full filling our “godly duty” and when we’re old we are dried up and exchanged for a “younger model”

He said it wasn’t that deep and that he just meant her eggs are old. I was making sure he didn’t mean that she was expired as a woman.

He got a bit iffy wondering why I didn’t find it funny, and he thought it was weird that we’re on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to some forms of humor. I said I don’t want to have a long conversation about it, it could be funny if he meant it the right way, reminded him about women’s history and said that bottom line, I don’t care as long as you don’t mean no harm.

To be honest I wanted to correct him, but he would’ve gotten mad then.

So AITA? Was it a harmless joke, or was is sexism rooted in stereotypes about women’s worth?",No A-holes here,1pclv4v
"AITA for buying my dog more presents to unwrap? This is a really unnecessary fight with my sister but just need someone to tell me i'm not in the wrong lol. So basically we both have dogs and like to buy them christmas gifts. She thinks i'm an asshole because i've already bought more gifts for my dog than her dog has. I don't think it's too big of an issue because both the dogs will end up playing with the toys after christmas 

She thinks it's not fair that my dog will have more presents to unwrap (my dog always waits to unwrap his presents with us) but I think she should just buy more for her dog if she's that concerned? She spends most of her money on things she doesn't need but argues that she has less money to spend on her dog so I should either buy my dog less or divide the presents equally. I think that's unnecessary and if I want to spoil my dog I should be able to, it's not like her dog is going to count how many gifts it has under the tree. And again the dogs can share the toys after christmas, I just like watching my dog have fun unwrapping his gifts. ",Everyone Sucks,1pd8ehz
"AITA for telling my neighbor to move if he doesn't want to share the elevator with a dog? Edit: I appreciate everybody's responses. I posted this right before I went out to try and see the aurora. I'm reading these whenever the aurora dips and I'll try to reply when I can. I've noticed some people think I'm deathly afraid of spiders and would freak out if somebody brought a pet spider with them. No, because you can only have dogs and cats here. If I saw one in the elevator, I'd take another one like an adult.

I (27F) live in a building that allows up to 2 dogs with no breed or weight restrictions. I have a 12 YO Chiweenie who's nothing but sweet. She rarely barks and does good with everybody, including cats.

I took the elevator so she could go on her walk (sit down on the sidewalk), and this kid (20-ish) was in there first. He asked me to not come in, but I told him we have every right to use the elevators and came in. He basically squished himself into the opposite corner, started shaking, and asked me to put her behind my legs because he's scared of dogs. I told him that if he's scared of dogs, he shouldn't live in a dog-friendly apartment. He stuttered out that he wasn't asking much of me. I told him that it's entitled to ask others to accommodate his triggers. By the time this was over, he literally ran out the elevator.

This one lady working at the front desk asked me if everything was okay, and I told her he was being a baby over sharing an elevator with my 7 pound dog. She went, ""I don't want to get involved, but the next time something like that happens, please take the next elevator."" I didn't want to get on management's shit list, so I just nodded and walked away.

I asked a few neighbors who have dogs, and they all said I was in the wrong and shouldn't have even gone in the elevator. I asked my friends and family, and everybody thought I was being rude. My aunt replied, ""It costs nothing to be kind to people despite what your generation seems to think."" AITA? I'm scared of spiders but I don't make it everybody else's problem.",Asshole,1g0ytih
"AITA for telling my husband not to hire a video editor even though it’s affecting our relationship? My husband recently landed a well-paying job as a welder, working 12-hour shifts most days. Before this job, his main hobby was content creation — he loved filming, editing, and uploading videos online. It was never a source of income, just something he enjoyed doing.

Now that he’s working full-time, he barely has the time or energy to edit his videos. He came to me asking if he could hire a video editor so he could still enjoy his hobby without spending hours editing. I told him I didn’t think that was a good idea because we have other important expenses to prioritize — health insurance, car insurance, bills, groceries, etc. He already knows how to edit, and I felt that hiring someone else would be unnecessary when we’re trying to save.

He reluctantly agreed and dropped the idea, but ever since, he’s been distant. If he’s not at work, he’s either recording and editing his videos or sleeping. We barely spend time together anymore. I brought it up, and he said that editing takes up the only free time he has, but it’s the only way he can still feel like himself and enjoy life outside of work. I can’t help but feel like he’s being petty by choosing editing over spending time with me, especially since I compromised by not stopping him from doing content creation entirely — just asked him not to spend on an editor.

AITA for telling him not to hire one, or is he just being immature about this?


EDIT: We both contribute financially to the household. Our financial situation has been gradually improving after a period of difficulty. I am somewhat concerned about the possibility of him hiring a video editor, as I am uncertain about the intended payment amount. I looked up standard rates for editors online and believe that the cost may not be necessary given our current expenses.",Asshole,1m16ekd
"AITA for telling off my wife for taking my daughter on an unnecessary shopping spree? Wife and I (both 46) have 2 kids, Amelia (15f) and Logan (12m). It's back-to-school season at every store around us and school starts mid-August for them. My wife and I have an agreement that she takes Amelia shopping and I take Logan shopping. She took Amelia shopping today as it was her day off and I planned on taking Logan over the weekend since he has soccer camp on weekdays. I was at work while they were shopping so I didn't hear from them until I got home. My expectation is that the kids get clothes and supplies for school. We also give them each a budget of up to $300, which almost never completely gets spent. This might be excessive to some but please refrain from commenting on it, especially since clothes are expensive these days (we only buy from higher end stores since we want their clothes to actually last the year), we buy them clothes for the full year, and it's for both supplies and clothes.

When I came home and asked my daughter what she got she showed me the clothes she got. She just got a few outfits as well as some extra clothing so she can mix and match outfits. She also got a new backpack, jewelry, a couple makeup things, and water bottle as well as a stationary set. I thought that was it but then she brought out a couple other bags. She got a pina colada candle from a candle store, a stuffed toy from Build a Bear, and a couple books. I asked how she got them and she said there was a sale going on at the clothes store, meaning she got a discount on a lot of the clothes and the backpack, and the rest she got from clearance. She realized she had money leftover after so my wife allowed her to get some extras. I was angry and told her she was going to take the extra stuff back and she got upset and said no. My wife said she had the money so she's allowed to. I said she wasn't allowed to just buy frivolous things when we go school shopping and that Logan would be asking me to get him extra stuff too if he saw this. She called me an AH and said Amelia followed the rules so who cares if she got something extra. She doesn't need those extra things though and whatever was left unspent we're supposed to take back.

"AITA for wanting my best friend to have a boyfriend? This is on a throwaway account because I know that she reads these

&amp;#x200B;

My (21f) best friend (22f) has never had a proper boyfriend. That doesn't initially seem like a problem, but I'm in a long term committed relationship and I want her to experience what I'm feeling but she never actively tries to meet any guys. I'm also pregnant and I've always wanted us to have our kids grow up together, even though she said that she didn't want children, I know she'll change her mind when she finds the right person, but it's just so hard since she won't even try to look for me. She always claims that she doesn't have any free time since she is studying at university and also working two jobs to pay her mortgage and bills since she doesn't live with her parents, but I know that she has at least two days a week where she does nothing. She also says that no one is ever really into her. I think these are just excuses though since she'll come home from work and say that a boy called her pretty, but she never asks them for their number or to go on a date with her. While I'd admit she's not the most conventionally attractive person, since she dresses quite emo which is out of place in our town, I wouldn't exactly say that she's ugly, just that she needs to try a little harder to be seen as more attractive. She seems happy in how she dresses and presents herself though, but I think it's a definite factor in why she doesn't get approached by any guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day she texted me after one of her shifts and told me that one of her customers had told her she had pretty eyes, and that he didn't make it a weird compliment or try to push it further, and that it made her happy because it seemed genuine rather than creepy like it usually is. When I asked her if she gave him her number she got pissy with me, once again saying that she didn't want to date the guy and that she just appreciated the genuine compliment for once. I'll admit I got frustrated with her and told her that she's being selfish by not going on a date with anyone who shows interest in her and that she is running out of time and that she's never going to find a boyfriend at the rate she's going. I still kind of stand by those words, but out of anger, I told her that she embarrasses me by still being single at 22, that she's a shitty friend for not even trying to fix it, and that she can't rely on only her friends to be there for her all the time since boyfriends are more important since they may be a husband one day. She got really upset with me and told me to cool down before talking to her again and hasn't texted me since.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love her and just want the best for her, but my boyfriend thinks I went a little overboard. I agree telling her that she was a shitty friend for actively staying single was over the top, but I really think she needs to learn that one day when all her friends get married and she's still single that she's going to be alone.

"AITA for implicitly insulting a woman’s body after a college sexual encounter? I (25M) am a grad student at a school in the Southwest US.  After a party, I ended up going home with an undergrad (21F) I had just met and things went as things do. Overall it was a pleasant experience and she seemed like a nice person.  The trouble started when I got up to go to the restroom immediately after the deed and she looked upon my nude body and said “you are SO skinny and your **** is so big.”  I responded “well there are lots of things I could say about your body that I choose not to.” My words seemed to hang in the air and before long she was unceremoniously headed home in a cab.

Objectively, I’m about 20-40 pounds light for my height (6’2) and she’s reasonably above her optimal weight for her age (not that there’s anything wrong with that).  Roles reversed, I wouldn’t dream of saying anything that isn’t clearly positive to her in such a delicate situation.  That said, after the fact I’ve wondered if I was in the wrong.  

I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight. I’m a skinny guy naturally and gaining weight despite eating, sports, and working out is a challenge.  I think of “you’re so skinny” as pejorative to a male.  On the  other hand, there was a clear compliment in there and the remainder was either neutral or negative while my retort was clearly negative.  It’s worth noting she didn’t respond to my barb with kindness (there was no “I didn’t mean it that way” coming back my way).

"AITA for not listening to my gf's complaints about my best friend I (21M) have a girlfriend (21F) and we've been together for 1 year and 5 months now, though I've known her for more than 6 years. We get along extremely well and we understand each on almost everything. However, most if not all of the fights we've had so far were because of my cousin (25M), who I consider to be my best friend. Me and my cousin have been through a lot together and we've other had each other's backs for pretty much everything in life. My cousin is single and we both have very different personalities. I've always been a introverted person with few experiences in life and almost no luck with women. My cousin on the other hand is much more extroverted and has experienced a lot of things in his life, though today he has settled down and spends most of his time at home w/his family.

Having been in a bunch of relationships he also has a more ""detached"" mindset when it comes to women. He's not a cheater but he's always with a different women. He's been in 3 serious relationships in the past, and he told me he broke up because he realized he was with the ""wrong"" person. He also told me that after some time he realised his GFs were being too sensitive and he didn't enjoy the amount of ""drama"" they were bringing into his life. He said things such as ""When we (him and his ex) have a problem should we keep crying or try to find a logical solution?"". In these relationships he came out as the wrong person because he hurt the women he was with. When they became vulnerable with him he realized he didn't want their vulnerability. He also has the habit of hooking up with a lot of women. This doesn't mean my cousin despises of women. He treats every women in his family well and on my family as well. As for women in general, I don't have enough information to bring here, but from what I saw with his exes he treated them well (until the moment he broke up with them in a moment of vulnerability, of course). He has the habit of making sexist jokes (example: talking about women not being able to drive properly) though. I also have the habit of making these jokes with close friends, but it's not something I truly believe or encourage.

The issue between him and my gf is that ever since we started dating anything I do with my cousin becomes a problem for her. Examples of situations where she got mad at me and my cousin:

* When me and him went a festival together. We didn't drink, do drugs or anything similar.
   * Before I started dating me and my cousin used to go out a lot to parties and drink. He would frequently hook up with women even though I wouldn't. I believe this is the reason my girlfriend got mad at this situation. In her own words, she didn't ""trust me with him""
* When me and my gf had plans on a specific day (to stay at home) and I **asked** her if we could change because my cousin was around and suggested doing something else - going to a soccer match (Note: I only asked her, I didn't say we were changing plans, and my cousin doesn't live in the same city as we do so I rarely get to see him, even though I'm with my gf all the time)
* My cousin made a joke with her such as ""He's been to more concerts with me than with you"" and ""Now he only cares about being with you""
   * In isolation these seem like jokes made by a 5 year old, and to some degree they are, but they were made inside of a conversation / context. Even my girlfriend has had this ""acid"" kind of humor before. Example: One day she was talking about a famous comedian she likes and during the conversation she said ""why are you mad, just because you're not as funny as him"". I immediately told her not to make that kind of joke anymore, but you get where I'm going with this
* My cousin didn't send her a happy birthday message. He has a tendency to forget birthdays and in fact he's forgotten mine before.
* One day me and my cousin were hanging out with our friends and my girlfriend was there as well. Me and my cousin had a bit too much to drink so she believed he was a bad influence for me.

Knowing my cousin, I know he didn't say or do these things out of a bad heart / intention, but it hurt my girlfriend regardless and she never saw him the same way. I've tried talking to my gf to explain this (that it wasn't in his intention) but she doesn't seem to care and I've talked to my cousin about this and even though he agreed on not making these kinds of jokes anymore he thinks she was being sensitive.

My gf recently said that ""the less time you spend with him the better it is for me"" and she told me she didn't want me to go to a concert that I bought a ticket to go with my cousin. I wasn't just going with my cousin to this concert, but with my sister and 2 friends (that my gf knows and is also close to) were going as well. Now I don't know if I should confront my gf again and start another fight or find a lame excuse to tell everyone I'm not going.

Reading these things out loud I understand that my cousin is very imature and said unecessary things, but is it really to the point of us ending our friendship? I know we don't have to literally end our friendship, but it does feel like that. If he stays at my house I know my girlfriend will be mad. If we go out together I know she'll be mad. I really wanted him to be my best man at our wedding and now I have to rethink that decision.

I've already told my cousin about how one of his jokes offended her and ever since he hasn't done it again.

Whenever I try to talk about this with my gf and try to get her to understand my side and my cousin's side she says I'm invalidating her feelings. She frequently says that his actions and his words are bad for our relationship and he's trying to compete with her.

An important side note is that the gf of one of my close friends (lets call her Marie and call my friend John) also dislikes my cousin, for similar reasons:

* One day my cousin called Marie John's ""mom"" because she wasn't letting him do something
   * We were on the beach, John suggested picking us by car about 10min from where he was but Marie said no, she didn't want him to. After that I don't remember the exact words my cousin used but he called her John's ""mom""
* One day my cousin invited John and I to go to a concert that was going to happen in his city. John was excited and bought his ticket, but he forgot something important: His girlfriend. After he bought his ticket he realised he had made plans with his gf so he had to cancel his ticket. However, the simple fact of having forgotten about the plans and having bought the ticket was enough to make Marie pissed at John and my cousin. I assume she was pissed at my cousin because he didn't have the initiative of inviting her as well (but that's also John's fault).

"AITA for Causing a Neighborhood Feud Over a Gnome? Hi everyone,

I live in a usually peaceful suburban neighborhood where everyone gets along—until recently. It all started when my neighbor “Tom” placed a flamboyant, suggestive rainbow-colored lawn gnome in his front yard. This gnome isn’t just any gnome; it’s about 2 feet tall, posing provocatively, and adorned with a rainbow hat covering its private parts. It’s been the talk of the neighborhood and quite frankly, an eyesore.

Most of us have kept our opinions to ourselves, but the gnome is directly across from my living room window, and it’s been driving me nuts. In a moment of frustration, I decided to take action. One night, I sneaked over and moved the gnome to Tom’s backyard, thinking it would be out of sight and out of mind.

The next morning, Tom was furious. He knocked on my door and demanded to know if I had anything to do with his “missing gnome.” I tried to play it cool, but eventually, I admitted what I did. Tom was livid and accused me of trespassing and vandalizing his property. He also revealed that the gnome was a symbol of pride and acceptance for his recently out son, and it had deep sentimental value.

Now, Tom has rallied a few other neighbors against me, saying I disrespected his property and crossed a line. Some neighbors are accusing me of being homophobic, which was never my intention. I genuinely didn’t mean to cause this much trouble—I just wanted some peace and quiet without that suggestive gnome staring at me.

My mom and her dad live in the same city 4 hours away from us so we only visit 3-4 times a year. My mom expects us as company when we do visit, and it’s been this way since we dated. This arrangement never seemed to bother my fiancee until now. But again, my mom is anti social and also has my adult siblings and 2 yo nephew living with her so she’s quite busy. We hosted a wedding dinner in our parents city and my mom didn’t come to meet her side of the family, while she had members fly in from out of state. My mom had to watch my nephew so she declined, but kindly invited us over to her home that same night. That infuriated my fiancee. She said “why would I visit your moms house after she ignored our night”

There was another time she had a nursing graduation party at my FILS and my family didn’t come but was invited. That made her upset and just added to the “they don’t care” about stuff we have going on. She can’t fathom that my family doesn’t have to show up to anything for us, but she’s expected to visit there when we do finally see eachother. That’s honestly the only way I get to see my family, they are homebodies. She told me it’s embarrassing to constantly explain this to her side of the family.

Well, my fiancées mom passed away this summer and we visited my mom last month and that was the icing on the cake for my fiancée. She told me once we got home she was greatly offended that my mom couldn’t ask her how she’s been doing, hug her, or even share her condolences upon visiting. She told me she’s exhausted because she’s the only one that seems to GAF. She asked me if my mom even knew her mom passed away and I told her I mentioned it when she passed. She told me she’s tired of being expected to visit when my mom clearly doesn’t reciprocate visits, or ask about her wellbeing. 

I don’t understand why my fiancée can’t lower her expectations because I told her my mom is just a shy person. She doesn’t believe me because it’s not fair “the expectations fall on her” and my mom gets a pass to be unempathetic and low effort in our lives. She also mentioned my mom hasn’t anknowleged or asked about the wedding and she just has a list of what my mom hasn’t done. My in-laws are far more supportive and close as a family so we spend the majority with them anyway. One of the last things she said to me was “I cant imagine bringing kids into this” as in she won’t want to have kids with me because my mom doesn’t come to stuff? 
I don’t know what to tell my mother because recently i’ve been having to visit alone, and my mom will ask where she is, and assume there’s an issue. I now have to think of excuses for her not attending.
My fiancee has washed her hands and now i’m in the middle. It’s such a lose lose situation. 

I told her even though I understand her expectations of my mother is low, can’t she be the bigger person and just visit with me the 3-4 times we do visit? My fiancee has been extremely upset and hasn’t talked to me in almost a week because of this. AITA?

"AITA for not inviting my son’s dad to my wedding? I will be getting married in December this year with my fiancé (obviously!), I am currently 7 months pregnant with our first child together. I had a fling with my ex co worker when I was on a break from my fiancé a couple of years ago and I ended up getting pregnant and gave birth to our son. 

I was previously on good terms with my ex co-worker (we’ll call him Ant) but things have got hostile recently as my son is very young and I feel he imposes too much, he takes my son every weekend and sometimes for a week or two (with my consent). Me and my fiancé are building a family and my son is very much apart of that, we are liking it as the 3 of us and soon to be 4. I am grateful Ant is involved in my sons life however, considering my fiancé is there my son already has a father figure and it is too much for us.

We don’t know how we can handle this as we do not want to take it to court, I work as a Paralegal and I think it would just be unnecessarily complicated.

My wedding will be in the south of France as my fiancé is half French and his Father lives there so we will be staying there for 3 weeks, I think this will be a nice time for us all to have quality time together 

My bridesmaids, and many guests have already planned to stay for 5-10 days as a holiday and to be there for when we Wed but I do not want to invite Ant as I just know he will impose and want our son everyday and I know it will ruin everything. I just want me, my son, my baby and my fiancé to spend a couple of weeks just us.

"AITA for telling my daughter ""this is a dictatorship, not a democracy""? My daughter (18F) started university and met some friends there who have encouraged her to completely change her style. My daughter used to be perfectly fine wearing slightly baggy boot cut jeans, gym shoes, regular shirts, etc., but since school she has completely changed her style. 

Most of its fine but there are some things that are just too much, like a [pair of skinny jeans](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=547194#pdp-page-content) that way too tight. My daughter is also curvier than the pictures shown so it looks even more revealing.

I'm not comfortable with wearing certain clothes. After her latest shopping trip with her friends, I asked her to show me what she bought and try it on, and she showed me clothes like the above. I told her she needs to take the revealing ones back and return them.

Naturally, she complained, and I kept my composure, but did state that ""This is a dictatorship, not a democracy."" It's a little on-the-nose, but it adequately explains who has the ultimate say here, especially since she's using my money to purchase. AITA?",Asshole,154rdo6
"AITA For Going through my Stepdaughter’s Room? Okay, I, 31F, have been dating Peter, 41M for about 2 years now. I have 3 Step-kids, 16F, 13F, and 9M. Their mother is still in their life and has them every other week. The 16 YO, Bridget, and I work at the same local restaurant in our town. I have been working there as a cashier a year before I met her Dad, and got her a hosting job there when we started dating. Bridget is a very outgoing person and has made made friends of all ages at the restaurant. I am not a very outgoing person and choice to make a few close friends that work the same job as me. Fast forward to a few days ago. Bridget is close friends with a older waitress, Elle, and I know Elle does weed. I have no problem with what people do with their bodies, but I do not think children should be doing them at all. I was cleaning the woman's bathroom, when Elle and Bridget walked in. They were talking and laughing for a few minutes, before Elle says, ""I only have one ediable left for you, do you still have that vape I gave you?"" I immediately started coughing really loudly so they would know someone was in the bathroom, (I was cleaning the toilet in the stall, so they did not see me) They both scrambled out of there. I was in disbelief. I got home before Bridget did that night and decided to go through her room. I looked everywhere and under everything I possibly could. I will admit, it was very obvious someone went through the room, but I didn't care to put anything back cause I was blind with rage. The next day at work, Bridget came up to me while I was with a customer and started yelling saying I went through her room, she knew I did. I told her I was worried about her safety, and she flipped me off and walked away. Later that night, Peter was mad at me, saying that was not my place and I should not have done that. So, I need to know, am I the asshole?


Edit: I have a few additional things to add, 1. Peter and I rent the house together, both of our names are on the contract, however I do pay sole rent at the moment, as he is currently unemployed. 2. For the people asking why I am freaking out when it's just weed, my sister died of overdose when she was 16. Even though she did not die from weed itself, I am strongly against teens using any kind of drugs all together. I know weed is pretty harmless, but I still worry for the safety. Bridget also knows this story. Bridget has ignored me for the past few days. I will update in a few days.",Asshole,1kkhdmk
"AITA for asking my sil if she’s bringing anything else? My brother just married Sara. She’s Mexican and she’s coming for thanksgiving. She said she’s bringing both sweet and savory tamales. So I guess one is turkey and the other is pineapple. I thought this was strange but my brother said they are good. 

I asked if she was bringing anything else because I don’t know of anyone else other than my brother and his wife eating that for thanksgiving. Sarajust sorta ignored me and I told my mom. 

My mom said I was so rude and she’d be excited to try something different. Mom lectured me as a host but everyone normally brings a little something but I think my SIL needs to read the room and bring something that is for thanksgiving and not some random dish that she came up with. 

My brother said if I say one word to his wife he’s calling me out and leaving accusing me of being racist over something so stupid. Normally everyone brings a little dish and tamales sounds like rolls and sweet rolls and I already made those.",Asshole,181flut
"AITAH for ""overreacting"" when I found out my mom had a previous marriage for 10 years I didn't know about. I 18m have two moms and a twin bro. I have always had a solid relationship with my family. However, I was filling out some paperwork(I’m about to join the Navy) with my mom, one page asked me if any of my parents had a previous marriage. My mom looked at me and said I don’t want to fill this out cause I don’t think we have talked about this. She then told me that my other mom was married to a dude for 10 years before they met. For the past 18 years I have literally never heard of this. I knew they both had boyfriends in the past but so did most closeted lesbians in the 70s\\80s. I thought my mom was joking so I called my other mon who was at work and she reluctantly confirmed this. I hung up abruptly and joked about what else she was hiding from me but I was clearly shocked and gobsmacked. After getting on her about why she didn't tell me, she said she didn’t think it was a big deal and told me I was over reacting.

Let me make something clear. I’m not mad that my mom is divorced or that she was married to a man, I’m mad that neither of them told me. I am 18 for christs sake. And it gets brought up when I’m doing paperwork? I feel a little betrayed that they felt they couldn’t tell me this. I get that she doesn’t want to lament on a part of her life she moved on from but I’m shocked they waited 18 years to tell me this. It has completely uprooted a narrative I believed since I was a boy(not necessarily in a bad way it’s just jarring). I’m gonna talk to her when she gets home but lmk what you guys think.

"AITA for wanting my brother to put in a good word for me? I (F19) go to college with my brother ""Adam"" (M21) and his best friend ""Evan"" (M21). Evan was one of the most popular kids at our high school. I've had a crush on him ever since I was in like 7th grade but we never really talked to each other, probably just because I was young, so my feelings died down. Now we all go to the same school and I went to a hangout with both of them &amp; a bunch of friends. Just like in HS, Evan is the life of the party, talking to everyone, super friendly and charismatic. All the feelings I had for him kind of came back in that moment.

After the party I asked Adam what Evan's status was, and he made a face and said it was a bad idea. I asked him what he meant, and he said that Evan *just* went through this huge breakup with a girl he had been dating since high school and he's basically sworn off of dating forever. I felt really sick to my stomach in that moment honestly because we're all pretty devout Christians. I've never dated anybody, neither has Adam AFAIK and I figured Evan was the same way, it was kind of hard to reconcile that with what I know of him plus I've never seen him with a girl ever. That was basically the end of the conversation, I felt pretty heartbroken and messed up about it all.

It's been a semester or so since then and I feel like I've gotten over it, I really still like Evan and still want to be with him. I brought it up to Adam again to see what he said. He FLIPPED OUT. He said I was insane and I should just leave him alone. For some backstory, the reason he says I'm insane is that I've spoken to my parents about him and they agree that we would be a good match.

He said he knows I think I'm in love with him but I've never spoken to him, I've never hung out with him and literally all I know about him is how he acted in the hallways in high school. He says he's talked to Evan about it and Evan would never date the sibling of someone he's friends with. Obviously I freaked out about this and asked why he would go behind my back to talk to Evan about me and he said that Evan's the one that brought it up and that he was talking about a separate situation.

My thoughts on this are that if it's a separate situation then a) obviously Evan isn't 100% done with dating and b) situations are different so just because he wouldn't date someone else's sibling it doesn't mean he wouldn't date me. So Adam really just gave me reasons to pursue Evan instead of leaving him alone LOL.

I asked Adam if he could just put in a good word for me with Evan, or set something up where he and I can have a conversation, or IDK do something so that I can actually do what he says and see that Evan and I click. He told me there was no way in hell he was going to do that. I'll admit I might be the AH here but I called him a bad brother and said he just didn't want us to date because it would be weird for him. He told me to leave it alone and just please drop it.

I feel like I've been an AH to Adam and maybe to Evan without knowing. Am I?",Asshole,1kv8iyl
"AITA for skipping Thanksgiving plans my family made over wearing makeup and furry talk? I, (23M) walked out on plans to celebrate Thanksgiving over the weekend over conflicts with my family regarding my involvement with being a furry and wearing makeup. 

Yesterday, I decided to test the waters and put on a bit of makeup to give it a try and see how it looks and how it felt. I applied Foundation and Concealer that I had thought matched my tone, took a picture and said ""good enough"", it was my first time applying any makeup really but all things considered it didn't look all that bad. It took a little longer than I am willing to admit, but I brought some makeup wipes with me just in case. For context, while my family isn't a religious one, it is a conservative one. 

When I arrived for a family dinner last night, my makeup wasn't immediately noticeable, I had felt relieved thinking I actually did it right the first time. We start talking and my Mom asks about anything that is going on with my life. I told to my Mom about my plans to go out of state to a few furry conventions, where she interrupted me and asked me to not use the F-word, especially when the family visitors arrive. Although she doesn't like cursing much she meant the word ""Furry"", like how Harry Potter isn't allowed to use the M-word, ""Magic"" in Vernon Dursleys house idk. 

It was at that moment my sister, (18), was staring at me, squinting her eyes. ""You look different, are you wearing makeup!!?"" I replied, ""Yes! Does it look good?"". Both my Mom and my sister immediately respond with no and starting grilling me, demanding why I would do such a thing, as well as telling me to fix it, meaning wipe it all off. I go out to my car and bring in the wipes and clean myself up. As I do, my Mom continues asking me why, I tell her, ""Because I wanted to try it"". She says that answer was not good enough and I need to explain myself further. I tell her I really don't need to explain myself and we should leave it at that. 

Shortly after, the out of town family arrives and the night is smooth sailing from there. I get home and my Mom sends me a text saying that it was good to see me, she loves me, and looks forward to our plans this weekend. Well, this morning, everyone begins to pack and my Mom becomes furious after learning that I had planned on driving up to the Airbnb she rented myself, because I wanted to drive my car. And said that I needed to start thinking about others and not myself. Turns out she had planned on all of us going to her house so we can pack the food and prepare for the trip. I was not at all brought up to speed on that and thought we would all drive ourselves and bring the food we bought. 

We end up arguing more about last night with the makeup and furry talk, and she explained how she had every right to protect her children from that kind of behavior and talking about furry's, as these impressions are what they do not need at their age. Saying ""MEN don't wear makeup!"" I walked out feeling emasculated for being the man I want to be, and for trying new things.",Everyone Sucks,1p8fl5c

"AITA for telling my friend that laziness is what makes her unattractive? My roommate(20F) who is also my friend, has never been confident about her looks. She complains it, she never like selfies nor taking pictures with herself in it.


She is mildly overweight, but her meats are well distributed giving her good curves. She has freckles and acnes, but not very obvious unless you look closely. She has full lips, but they are a little unhealthy because she has a poor blood circulation. She has amber eyes, but her eyelids are thick and making her eyes look small. 


Overall, when she says herself that she looks unattractive, I agree, and I don't have any ill will towards her. She also never wears any sort of make-up nor use any skin products, nor shave, nor putting any effort to look any way she wanted to be. Not saying like its a bad thing but that's what she does.


I don't want to describe myself because that seems to be a little awkward consider I am the one writing but just know that I like making myself feel good and look good on camera. This isn't something I am born with but something I work on everyday.


So we were talking about random stuff earlier and somehow we brought up about looks. My friend then went on and say that I am lucky to look attractive while she has always been unattractive. I then observed her(as what I've described above) and gave her some advices. I used to give her the same advices but she had always brushed me off saying nothing works on someone as unattractive as she is. 


However this time I think I got impatient and crossed a line. I told her that laziness is what made her unattractive. She could just try to work on something, be it the usages of beauty products or treatments, exercise, anything and they could have make her look much better. She admits that she is unattractive and had aways been just too lazy to put in any efforts to change.


She is quite mad at me right now, saying that I am just shaming her for her looks. I feel a little bad but I also think that what I said is true, if she is not proud of how she looks and too lazy to change then laziness is the reason that she stays this way.

"AITA for calling my sister selfish because she doesn’t let us hold or see her new baby? So I (17F) was recently blessed with a little nephew about 3 months ago which I am so grateful for, but my sister (29F) has been off since he was born and even before then. Let me list out a few:

Prenatal:

\- She didn’t want anyone to come to her prenatal ultrasounds aside from her husband (my BIL). They were fine showing us the photos from them, but she never wanted us to come. Additionally, she refused to do a transvaginal ultrasound which would have given a better view of my nephew.

\- Never let us touch her belly and was constantly trying to cover it like with a pillow or her coat,  especially towards the end of her pregnancy.

\- She wouldn’t let us be in the delivery room. She insisted on wanting only my BIL in there. She didn’t want anyone visiting her until after my nephew was born.

\- She really wanted to try a natural birth with no epidural even though she is a pretty small person. When my mom bought up trying a c-section, my sister wouldn’t listen.

\- Part of me thought she was faking the pregnancy, but I did see her changing clothes or taking on and off a sweatshirt and leaning back to stretch and there was very much so a baby in there.

Baby!!

\- She doesn’t want anyone around when she’s nursing aside from my BIL on occasion. He says it can be painful to her and that she’s not comfortable doing it in front of us… why? We’ve all seen boobs before. Girl… it’s literally all she has to do. Her husband changes the diapers, plays with him, and all that. She just needs to feed him.

\- She lost weight pretty fast following the birth. Her stomach took like two months to return to normal, but she lost most of the baby weight pretty quick because…

\- She eats like a bird. At thanksgiving, she picked at her plate and when I called her out on it, she got upset. My BIL and her went into a room away from people and he got her to eat a bit.

\- She’s gross. There always seems to be spit up or milk or something on her shirt. I’ve seen her wear the same shirt days in a row.  Her hair is always greasy or tangled, her hands have these bruises because she does this thing where she cracks her knuckles all the time and bends her fingers back.

\- She doesn’t like anyone touching the baby. My parents can hold him and I can do, but at thanksgiving she wouldn’t allow for any of our family to hold him People are going to want to hold him and it’s a little selfish of her to not let them.

Anyways, she and my BIL let us know that she wanted to spend Christmas Eve by themselves. The whole thing just seems super selfish to me and I told her that and now she’s not texting me back. I’m worried, but mainly annoyed.

"AITA for suggesting my sister takes down her unborn baby pictures? So my sister (29F) has 3/4 kids. She’s a little “not all there” I think after what happened about 4 years ago. 
She told me ever since we were pretty young she wanted 4 kids one day so maybe this is some way she copes with not being able to have a fourth? Just an observation.

Anyway, in between baby 2 and 3 she had a baby that did not make it. In the upstairs hallway she has a little wall for each kid. With their name and pictures. The catch is… there’s 4 walls, not 3. One of the walls has what would have been their name, a few ultrasounds, a handprint, and a shelf on the wall with an urn.

She was complaining about making space for some pictures of her husband and I said she should take down the miscarriage pictures.

She said “what?” And I just explained it’s just a little odd because nobody really needs to know you had a miscarriage plus it’s kind of weird putting a collage of her kids next to a kid that never existed.

She said he did exist and is her son. So I just said whatever and dropped it. Later that night she sent me a long text about how disappointed she was in my suggestion and how she is a “mother of 4” no matter what “dumbass” says otherwise. Then she just went in about how I’m probably just jealous because she has a husband and kids and I don’t.

"AITA for being ""rude"" with the wine I brought to a dinner party? I (18M) started university this past week and was yesterday I went over to a new classmate's (Aaron 20M) house for dinner. Basically, we are grouped together in class for the semester, and Aaron planned this dinner so we can all get to know each other.

It was a potluck and I was asked to bring wine as my contribution. One of the girls in our group (Breanna 18/19F -not sure age), said that she loves red wine. There were going to be 6 of us at the dinner (5 classmates + Aaron's roommate) so 4 guys and two girls.

It was my first dinner party without family but my mum to help me choose some wine to bring. I ended up bringing two bottles of wine ($20 each). It was more expensive that I had bought before but wanted to bring something good for this group. FYI I am in Canada where it is legal to buy alcohol at 18.

When I got to the dinner, I gave Aaron the wine and he was very complimentary of my choices. But when the dinner started, he didn't put the bottles on the table... instead he had poured both bottles of wine into glass wine containers. I didn't understand why because I usually just pour wine from the bottles.

Well when dinner started, everyone was talking about the food and someone asked me what I brought. Aaron said immediately that I bought the wine, and everyone said it was really good. But I felt like, because they were in the glass containers, nobody could really know how good the wine was without looking at the bottle. So I went to the kitchen and got both of the empty bottles and passed them around the table. I said they were expensive but they were on sale and said the price of each bottle.

This is where the issue started. When the bottles got to Aaron, he stood up to bring them back to the kitchen. But not everyone had seen them yet so I said to keep passing them around because Breanna hadn't seen the bottles yet. I said that because Aaron put the wine in the containers, nobody know how good the wine I brought was, and that he shouldn't have put the wine in the containers without asking me about it first. I felt like it wasn't fair.

Aaron said that all the food was put onto serving plates and nobody knows or cares about the cost of the food items. He said that because I brought such good wine it was proper to put it into a wine container to let it air, and I was an asshole and trying to rub in everyone's face the cost of the wine.

But I wasn't. I only wanted people to know that it was good wine and not cheap wine, and when you put the wine in the containers nobody can tell. I only said the cost of the wine because I wanted to point out that I got it on sale.

Well... things cooled down, but I felt mad that I got called an asshole and left the party after dinner. I chatted with a different friend in the group this morning and he said everyone stayed for a couple more hours and some of them also thought I was being rude and weird about the wine.

"AITA for calling my husband “pretentious” for reading everything in a museum and leaving him when travelling Europe? Throwaway account here because my husband follows my Reddit.

I (F29) am currently travelling around Europe with my husband (M32). We've planned this trip for a long time and so far it's been everything I could have wanted and more. I have one minor gripe though: my husband reads absolutely everything at every museum or gallery we visit.

We both appreciate culture and art, and I love immersing myself in a gallery as much as anyone, but my husband takes this to a whole new level. We go to an art gallery and he reads the art labels of every single piece. It's the same if we visit the museum; every single exhibit has to be examined in great detail. I wouldn't mind at all if it was the occasional piece as I do that myself when my interest is piqued, but he reads absolutely everything. I refuse to believe he has a genuine interest in every exhibit or painting, and we end up spending far too long in places, which impacts the rest of our trip.

I mentioned this to him, and he said he just wanted to maximise his enjoyment and immerse himself fully because we'd be unlikely to ever return. Although I told him I would appreciate it if we could hasten, nothing has changed.

After spending 4 hours in one gallery where we'd barely even scratched the surface, I said to him that we needed to quicken the pace and read less. Again, he replied that he was soaking it all in; due to my annoyance, I told him he was pretentious and did not have an interest in most of the things he was reading, and it was a means of appearing sophisticated and cultured.

He called me rude and said that it was as much his trip as it were mine and if I wanted to do something else, I was free to do so. At that stage, I had enough and left the gallery to go and wander around a nearby park. When he'd left the museum around 3 hours later and we ate together, it was strained; he told me I'd been unnecessarily hurtful and he was just appreciating these historic landmarks.

We apologised to each other but I feel maybe I was harsh. AITA here for calling him pretentious and leaving him?",Asshole,1fk62ji

He said it again, still laughing, and I got cross, told him that was very offensive and told him to shut up. He was upset.

My wife was annoyed at me for this, she doesn't understand why it's offensive and pointed out he doesn't understand anyway. But while I'm fine with the term ""vasectomy"", to me ""neutered"" has implications for masculinity (or lack thereof), as well as being a different op, and I could just see him gleefully telling his friends or their parents that I'd been neutered (since telling him it was different didn't stop him repeating it).

My suspicion given my wife's reaction is that women will largely think I'm being childish and men will largely think I was right, but I don't know. AITA?",Asshole,1izrc9p
"WIBTA if I refuse to pay for my daughter's university if she switched? So my daughter (19f) is currently in first year studying IT. She recently gave me a letter, telling me about her wanting to switch to cognitive science instead of staying in IT. She gave me her reasons, what she plans to do in the future with her cognitive science degree, and some of the consequences if she didn't switch.

Now, I think that she's making a big mistake by doing this. 1. Cognitive science is less recognized than IT, so it's less likely that she'd be hired. She needs to keep her options open. 2. She never showed a genuine interest in it. If she had, then I would all be for it. 3. She's doing a computer science-related courses anyways so it wouldn't be much of a difference.

So I told her how I felt about this decision. She said I can help her out with some of the career prospects, and that university is about self-discovery; people switch majors all the time and that there are even those who switch four times to figure out what they liked. I disagree with this notion; you go to university to get a job, not for fun. I asked her that she could just stay in the IT program and then do a masters or even a PhD in cognitive science later. But she doesn't want to. She said that she will go into cognitive science and that I need to be supportive of her unconditionally, especially since she's financially dependent on me.

I told her that while I didn't initially plan for her to go to graduate school, I would be more than glad to pay for her masters in cognitive science if she stayed in IT, but if she chooses to switch now, then I will not pay. She got upset with me, telling me that she's dependent on me, that it's my job as the parent to be supportive, and that she shouldn't have to feel like she's in a warzone to tell me what she wants. I told her that it's for her own good, and she replied saying that I'm forcing her to do IT even though she's not happy with it and how is me not paying for her tuition fees any good for her.

I told her that I'm methodological in my thinking, that IT is a good career for her, and that I'm just putting pressure on her, not forcing her. She started crying and screaming at me, saying things like I'm a horrible father, that he won't have a daughter, and that I should be proud of her for choosing her own path. I was shocked. I think that I'm doing the right thing and that she's making a mistake, but maybe I'm wrong. What do you think. AITA?",Asshole,1b0oyc3
"AITA for wanting to go to my son's foot ball game rather than my daughters dance recital? Fake names for privacy purposes, first time reddit user,just need advice. I 45m  have two children, Tara f16, and Chad m14. Some backgroud tara''s been dancing since 3 years old, and I've been going to her recitals since she started dancing. Now here's the problem, on Saturday was her dance recital. But on that Friday was my son's first foot ball game of the season. And if you know anything about foot ball games they can run very late, and the next day I was planning on taking Chad to have a father son day, go brunch go to the movies, play video games, and all that fun stuff, so told my wife this and she told me that I can't because of the dance recital. When I asked my wife, Molly  35f  if I could just skip it this one time, because I've gone to them for the past 13 years. My wife told me that our daughter would be very upset if I didn't go, so I sat tara down and asked her how she would feel if I didn't go. She said that if I wanted to I could, but didn't get why me and Chad couldn't do it that Sunday. Me and my son have had this day planned for a few weeks, while I didn't know about the recital until a couple of days before it happened. So that Saturday me and my son did the things we had planned, but when we got home my wide was very upset with me because I didn't go.

"AITA for drinking the energy drink? This sounds so dumb, and I don't get why she's so mad at me. But my gf went to the gym this morning, then to the grocery store, and when I got up I decided to drink the last energy drink in the fridge and start cleaning my car.

She was in a pretty good mood when she got home 2½ hours later, unloaded the groceries and said she might help clean my car later. When she was putting stuff away in the fridge I heard her yelling and cursing at me from the inside the house. I asked her what was up and she just yelled at me that I'd drank the last energy drink.

I mean, yeah, I did. Because I like the caffeine hit and she was at the shop, why didn't she get more? She yelled that she did get more but that they're all warm and will take hours to be cold enough to drink and that I was so inconsiderate because I can drink coffee, etc. I love coffee, the smell makes her sick though, but I wanted an energy drink.

Anyway, she was making such a fuss and was literally sobbing, so I walked the 2 minutes to the corner shop and got her the same brand but a different flavour, they were sold out of the one she likes. I was pissed that she was making such a fuss about this, so I slammed it down in front of her. She was still crying and yelled that she can't drink any of the other flavours because they're too sweet and make her sick. So I tried to give her the rest of my can, there was less than half I'll admit, but if she's that desperate for an energy drink, she can't complain.

She did complain. She gave it back to me and walked away crying hysterically just saying I'm an inconsiderate asshole who doesn't even think of her when she spent so much on groceries that were mostly for me. I got pissed at the guilt trip she was trying to pull on me, and asked if she was still going to help me with my car, because I really want to get it done today. 

She yelled at me to go fuck myself and is now lying on the sofa crying while I bust my ass cleaning my car by myself. She knows it's important to get my car cleaned so I get the best price for it, but she's too busy sulking over an energy drink.",Asshole,xz9g46
"AITA for not giving my son my old computer? Recently I (35M) got some surprise money from my grandfather. With it, I decided to do an upgrade to my desktop setup by building a new computer from scratch. Though the computer I had before was still relatively new, I decided upgrading my rig would help me get more into 3D modelling such as Blender, as well as increase the quality of my video processing for my gaming streams to help gain some extra income for the house.  


My son (18M) asked me if he could have the old computer, as he was hoping to get more involved with this weird hobby he has with recording VHS tapes. He's been doing it at the library since they apparently have a setup for that and has shown me some of the videos he recorded, and I honestly just don't get the appeal. Two years ago I gave him my old Gateway, and while he told me that it wasn't able to do video transfers, I told him that he didn't need a thousand dollar computer either in order to do that.  


I have a hard time believing that the video transfer thing is what he truly wanted the computer for, and that he just wanted an excuse to play more video games as he's done before. While he is an adult, he's still only in Grade 11 due to delayed development as a kid. I only gave him the Gateway for homework purposes, but since I gave it to him he's barely touched it, so I'm having trouble believing he'd have put the newer one to use considering he hasn't been productive with what he has now.  


I was originally planning on selling the computer on Kijiji, but I had a blunder the other day after getting in touch with an old friend for the first time in over ten years. He came over with his son, we had a few beers and whiskey, and I don't know what got into me, but next day I found out that I offered the computer to his son while drunk.  


My son was in the room while my wife told me, and while I didn't initially take much notice when he left, I shortly after heard a loud bang from the basement and went downstairs to find out what the sound was, only to find him standing in front of his computer which he had smashed the heatsink and motherboard.  


I was shocked, while I only gave him the computer after knowing it wouldn't have anything important for me left on it, I did have fond memories of it like playing Unreal Tournament with friends and using Limewire for family movies. I was frustrated, but kept my cool and simply said to him ""congratulations, now you have no computer at all"", to which he barked back at me ""not like I could fucking do anything on it"" followed by other curses at me.

"AITA for calling someone an alcoholic after they ruined parties for 2 years? I (18F) recently had a big results day party as we got our A-Level results here in the UK on the 14th. As a result, me and my friends were drinking, many of which are emetophobic (relevant later)

My friend, ‘Alex’ (18M) has a genetic medical condition that (in broad summary because I admittedly don’t understand it all) means nothing in his body works. He has recently got a mobility cane because his own legs can’t handle standing still without breaking or something similar.

All of my friends (about 11 total) all ate and drank about the same throughout the day, however Alex suddenly became very out of it and promptly passed out. This often happens as a result of his condition so we didn’t question it too much and set him on our decking in a sleeping bag so we didn’t disturb his rest (he is an insomniac) and didn’t throw up on my floor around emetophobics. 
Only by sheer chance did my mother notice him throwing up whilst unconscious, face down. She set him up and called us for help and he was still throwing up but had woken up by this point. My mother had gone to fetch scissors to cut him out his shirt it was so bad whilst I call an ambulance. 

He proceeded to lie to the paramedics about what he drank, so I told him later that he was an alcoholic who couldn’t handle alcohol and I don’t want him in my life after he ruined our decking. It has never been this bad but events like this have happened every time we met up for the last two years and I’m worried I may have been too mean when I, admittedly, snapped at him.

So Am I The Asshole for calling someone an alcoholic?

Edit1: noticing a lot of this so I thought I’d clarify. The medical condition is mentioned because his doctors say he shouldn’t drink, we have suggested he not drink so much in the past but he refuses, I have hosted about 8 parties at my house, 7 of which ended with Alex throwing up somewhere and attempting to continue drinking afterwards. He drinks when he is sad (after a friends funeral) to the point he blacked out regularly, and he hasn’t been able to go a single event (when he was 17 and we were 18, some of us were still 17 too) without drinking, even at the cost of violating the law by sneaking drinks in pubs.

Edit2: sent Alex a message apologising for the comment, thank you so so much everyone for helping me see things from a better perspective!
“Know you said not to message ya again but I just wanted to say one thing.

After Therapy and self reflecting, I’ve come to the realisation that calling you an alcoholic was not fair. It was a heavy label to put on you and unfair of me. Whilst you do have issues with overdrinking, it isn’t the same as being an alcoholic and I am sorry for that. 
And I am sorry I couldn’t take better care of you on results day, I did the best I could. And I hope you were able to salavge your shirt, I know it was your favourite. 

I do hope you find peace and a healthy relationship with alcohol going forwards x”",Everyone Sucks,1mxhn6l
"AITA for telling my coworker being a DogMom isn’t the same?  I 27F am a mom to 3 kids, 1bio 2bonus. The conversation about motherhood came up at work the other day with my boss 22F and coworker 24F whom neither are mothers. 

I don’t remember the reason, but I did joking say “because I’m a mom I am always right” at that Coworker chimes in with “Hey! I’m a mom too.” I replied “Sorry dog mom doesn’t count. I have plenty of animals at home, it’s not the same.” 

Then she proceeds to try to justify why being a DogMom counts and even starts saying it’s harder than being a Mother. Her reasons included, dogs are a commitment for their whole lives but once a kid turns 18 you can kick them out. Dogs can never feed them selves but my kids can. 

I ended up just saying “What? Kids are a life long commitment. It’s still not the same but okay whatever” and walking away to return to working. 

(Edited. Because I realized that I miscommunicated the order of events. Everything from below here was not actually said. Just thoughts and feelings afterwards) 

I’m sorry but what? My 14yo does most of the care for our 3 dogs, he’s usually the one to fill their food bowls and change out their water. Does that mean he’s a dad? My 10yo does the care for our cat feeding/watering is she a mom? Hell my 3 year old helps both of them. 

As for her argument of kids are only an 18 year commitment but dogs are lifetime, most dogs don’t even make it to 18yo… my kids will always be apart of me. I will worry about them until the day I die. 

Call yourself whatever you want but don’t try to act like it’s the same as being a parent. I get that you love your animals, I love mine too. But until you’ve had a baby wake you up to be fed a every few hours, or had a child come in for comfort in the middle of the night because of a bad dream, or sat out in 100+ temps at a ball game, or worried about if your kid is getting enough calories, or had you legs used ramps for car, or sat in the hospital for 1.5 days while your baby got chest X-rays and tests done because his O2 levels weren’t good, etc… there’s many other experiences that make someone a parents. However putting out a bowl of food and water to fur babies isn’t one of them to me. 


ETA - My initial comment was a JOKE. At my own expense. I say this joke when I’m objectively wrong for the irony of it. It could be something like me being like “the car was gray” them coming back and being like “actually the car was silver” my response “well I’m the mom so I’m right”. Not the actual scenario but you get the gist. Even with my next comment saying “being a dog mom doesn’t count” was also said in the same tone. She then started saying objectively incorrect things about how being a dog parent was harder to which I walked away.

I never in my OP said that you couldn’t love an animal. I as a matter of fact of fact love all of my own. Just said that there was a difference. ",Asshole,1cwal3u
"AITA for ranting to my friend about my dating life? I have been talking to a female friend who I have known for about 2 years now. We would often use playful banter and recently I started to do online dating which I am relatively new at.

I have had pretty bad luck with my dates and I was simply ranting to her about how dry my dating life is. I consider myself to be a nice guy and with the handful of dates that I have been on, they have all ended up in the friendzone. So as a thought experiment, I simply said ""What if I just stop being a nice guy and take on the polar opposite and be the bad guy for once?""

I told her I was obviously joking about this, but it was just me letting off some steam. She took it as me asking for her advice which I clearly wasn't. She also took it personally which I don't really understand how that could have been taken as an insult. For context, I would often rant to her about different things and this was no different. When I want advice, I will directly ask and she knows this. I asked what makes this any different from all of my other rants? She says that I am sounding like a jerk to which I said I wouldn't actually act on this, this is just me exploring what I need to do to get out of the friendzone.

Long story short, I apologized for how I acted but she cannot move on with being my friend anymore. Am I the asshole?

Edit: It seems a lot of people want to add random facts to validate their own responses. You are alll entitled to your own opinions, but it doesn't make them right. Also, therapy? Really? How would that help my dating lol

"AITA for relying on an older sibling while babysitting? I'm 18f who just graduated high school a few weeks ago. I've never had a job before, and now that I’ve graduated, I wanted to earn some money for experiences at community college. I asked my mom if she could help me find a job, and she suggested babysitting. I thought it would be easy.

My mom's supervisor needed a babysitter for the summer because their daycare shut down. They have two sons: Len, who's 10, and Bo, who's 5 and autistic. They reassured me that Len is very independent and prefers to be alone, so I would mostly need to focus on Bo. I’ve never dealt with autistic kids, but I figured it wouldn’t be too hard since he’s so young.

On my first day, I got to know the boys, and things started off pretty simple. Bo played with his toy cars for a few hours while Len stayed in his room. Around noon, I called them for lunch. I'm not great at cooking, so I just heated up some canned mac and cheese. Len was fine with it, but Bo burst into tears, saying he hated mac and cheese. I tried to get him to eat, but he kept crying.

Since I didn’t know much about autism, I asked Len for help. He was a bit rude but took Bo bowl, got him some fig bars, and that seemed to calm him down. When I asked Bo what he would like to eat in the future, he just made angry noises and ignored me.

Later, Bo started crying again because he couldn’t assemble his fire truck. He asked for help, and since I didn’t know what to do, I called Len again. Len complained and didn’t want to help, so I snapped and told him to help his brother or he wouldn’t get a snack later. He did it grudgingly, and things were fine for a while.

Some time passes, and I find Bo crying in the laundry room again. He told me his cat scratched him and made him bleed. I called Len again to put a band-aid on him because I wasn’t sure how Bo would react if I did it. Len looked really upset while doing it, but nothing else happened that day.

When their mom came home, I left. Later, I got a long, angry message saying I ""parentified"" Len and that it should’ve been my responsibility to take care of Bo. She said she didn’t want me to babysit anymore. I was livid because I feel like Len is very spoiled and can’t even handle helping out around the house.

My mom is mad at me, but my dad is on my side and is really angry with their mom.

"AITA for telling my friend i miss her old hair? IMPORTANT INFO: Since i’ve seen multiple people calling me racist for some reason: we’re both mestizo latin american, Liz is not black, she just has natural curly hair. 

I (26F) have a friend “Liz” (25F) since we were in high school. Liz has beautiful curly hair (dyed) ginger, I don’t know much about curls but looking at references i think she might have 3b or 3c hair.

Last week she came to church with pin straight hair and her natural brown color. I was totally taken aback since she never straightened her hair, not even to formal events, and had been dying her hair for years. I asked what was the occasion, thinking she just straightened it with an iron, and she told me she got it straightened with keratin.

I asked her why did she destroy her hair, and she told me I knew she had been really depressed and she wanted something “she could control”. I know she has been depressed. Around two months ago she underwent a knee surgery and has been walking with a cane, and just before new year her dog had to be put down. I get getting haircuts after being sad but i thought that was ridiculous.

Her hair was the most identifiable part of her,  the way she would style it was very fun and you could find her easily in a crowd. Today i tried to find her at church and told her that without her hair she was harder to find, this bothered me because now she just melts with the crowd and isn’t that special anymore. At lunch i told her i missed her old hair and felt like she had lost her fun personality with her hair. 

She didn’t reply but i noticed she was upset, our friend that was with us at lunch told me that was mean, I didn’t think i was but maybe i should apologize, AITA?

edit: okay i get it, i’ll apologize to her tomorrow

edit 2: this morning at 9 am i texted her apologizing for my reaction to her hair. I told her i was just shocked at the drastic change, that she looks beautiful and i hope her new hair is easy to maintain. She replied with two audio messages 30 minutes later, i saw the messages but was too busy so I waited until i was free to reply. At 6pm i check the chat and realize she deleted the audio messages so I explained to her that i was busy, to send them again, but Liz replied “it’s fine, it doesn’t matter anymore” so i said great. 

Thanks to everyone who commented, I apologized and I think maybe shes a little hurt but we’ll get over it as friends.

edit 3: today Liz was not at church, I ran into her boyfriend and asked where she and her sister were (she lives alone with her 15yo sister) and he is the one that drives them. He told me that she didn’t feel like going so she stayed. I texted her asking how she was and if could come over and bring them lunch, she answered that she didn’t want anyone to come over, that she was tired from work and didn’t want visitors. So i told her that if she needed to talk to anyone to text me.

Around 6pm i saw an instagram story posted by her sister of the three of them in the movies (the story was posted like 2 hours ago) so i texted her that i wanted to talk to her and is she wanted i could go to her place or we could talk on the phone, it’s 7pm and she hasn’t replied so i’ll be waiting.",Asshole,18zt3vv
"AITA for complaining about money to someone much poorer than me? I 32F used to be poor but now I'm probably considered rich. Most of my friends from high school and before are still pretty poor (I make like 10x their income). I was having brunch with my friend Linda (32f) and she was complaining about the crazy inflation and how currently it's so hard to make ends meet.

I said ""yeah I know right? I remember when horizon milk was 2$/half gal but now they were 7$ for half gallons now""

and she said I was too privileged to complain about cost of milk when she still struggles to pay 2$ for an entire gallon of milk of whatever was on generic brand.

I said sorry I was just trying to agree with her. The rest of brunch was a bit tense.

I also just in general have been having a hard time connecting with Linda and my other older childhood friends because we have different struggles. They seem to forget that just because I have more money, it doesn't mean I don't have struggles or I don't see their issues. I forget to filter what I say and it can rub them the wrong way even with good intention. I never thought I would become this privileged rich snob, but maybe I have without realizing it?

Background info on horizon: 

When we were kids, her family qualified for food stamps/gov aids, and mine didn't (back then we were trying to immigrate/obtain citizenship and were told if we got aid, we would be denied). Sometimes she would have horizon milk if they had a bit extra for food stamp. We would drink horizon as if it was pure luxury. We had joked once we become rich, we would be able to afford horizon milk. When I got my first (fastfood) job, I bought her a carton of horizon and joked how we were so rich at 16 to have our own horizon.

So my boyfriend put on a youtube video that was almost 2 hours long (backyard baseball?) while us and my parents were eating dinner. I watched part of it, and then went on my phone, and then would go back and forth while it was on. After it finished, i asked for the remote to turn my video on (it was fnaf the musical, only 25 min long). He then sat there and went “im not watching this” and was trying to get up. I was jokingly holding him down because i didnt want him to get up. Once he got up he said “i dont want to watch this, i want to play animal crossing im going upstairs”. I got upset because i willingly sat there and watched his thing, so i was hoping/expecting him to watch mine (which imo is the nice thing to do). He’s trying to tell me i’m being selfish and im not rightfully upset because he shouldnt have to sit there and watch my thing even if i sat there and watched his bc he “dodnt make me and no one was forcing me”.

"AITA for not paying rental fees for a PENCIL? I, 19F am currently a sophomore University student who is taking a basic art course for a GPA boost. I'm about one month into the course and things have been going smoothly for the most part. On the second day of class, I forgot my pencil case and had no drawing utensils. Obviously, this is problematic for an art class. I asked my seat neighbor, Danielle, to lend me a pencil. The pencil she leant me was one of those nice mechanical pencils. I looked up the brand online and they go for about $21. I used the pencil for the class period but decided to hold on to it because I might need it in other classes. 

  
I was in a rush so I stuffed the pencil in my tote bag. To make a long story short, I ended up losing the pencil. When I told Danielle this, she insisted that I pay her $5 a month until the pencil is returned. I agreed in order to pacify her and because I knew she could not be serious. Last Friday, she requested my first installment. I told her I would not be paying for a pencil and that she was making a big deal since she had 2 more of the exact same pencil. She claims I have no respect for other people's property and that I'm a jerk. She's also been discussing the matter with mutual friends and making things awkward.

"AITA for exposing my classmate? I (15m) have a classmate (15f). We don't really get along for many reasons but a big one is that I have always suspected that she was faking who she was. I don't mean full on faking being someone else like identity theft, but like pretending to be a different person than she actually is. She would use a name that didn't seem to make sense for her and really just did a lotta weird shit.

On Monday I overheard her talking and she mentioned a name that I thought would be her mom's. I went home and looked up the name she gave plus her last name (I memorized it because we had some assignments together and I would see her last name) on Google and found her mom on Facebook. I spent all night but didn't see anything about her but after a few days of looking I found a really old photo of her and found her real name. I took screenshots and texted them to my friends, who decided to spread them around.

Eventually the whole school knew her actual name and started calling her that.   A few people and teachers still called her the fake name but obviously everyone knew she was a liar atp. I got called into the office today and she was there with her parents. They reported me for ""harassment"" and said I purposely spread out her name to get people to harass her, but in reality I just wanted my friends to know the truth and they were the ones that spread it.

"AITA for allowing my teenage son to go to a party that my daughters weren't allowed to go to? My husband and I have four kids -- 21F, 19F, 17M, 14M.

We live in the same suburb that we grew up in. My husband and I both graduated from the high school that our girls graduated from and boys are currently attending. 

A long-standing tradition at the high school is a beach bonfire party for the juniors &amp; seniors after Homecoming. The party is synonymous with drunken shenanigans and all that stuff. I attended this party both my junior and senior year of high school. They were always wild. Dark night + outdoors + drinks + being on a secluded beach + all your friends + older guys = lots of fun as a teenager, terrifying as a mom.

I'm 44 and I realize now that some of the things that happened at those parties were wrong. Older graduates from the high school attended, there was a lot of coercion/peer pressure to do things we weren't always ready to do, and plus just being in the dark in a secluded place. 

My husband and I both agreed that we didn't feel comfortable with our older daughter going. A few years later, our younger daughter too. Our girls have always been trustworthy but we attended those parties and knew how intense they got. My older daughter was fine with it while my younger daughter was unhappy with our choice at the time but hasn't brought it up in years. 

This year our son is a junior and wants to attend the party with his friends. My husband and I discussed it and...honestly the concerns when raising daughters is just so different to raising sons. We agreed it was fine for him to go as long as he went with a group of friends and promised that he wouldn't get in the car if there was a drunk driver.

The problem is now that he's mentioned to his sisters that he is going and they are upset with us because they weren't allowed to go. I don't want to outright say the very difficult reasons why we were scared to let them go, but now they feel that we're unfair/sexist.

"AITA for sending my daughter to her room after she disrespected my wife? Posting on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. Also using a throwaway for privacy reasons.

I (42M) recently have gotten married to my wife K (34F). For background, I have a daughter D (13F). We moved back to my home country around a year ago after her mom, my first wife, unfortunately passed away. 

I met K a little after we moved in and we intsantly clicked. It was the type of connection I had not felt since my late wife and it was quite honestly a whirlwind romance. Six months later, I proposed and she moved in after we got married. She’s been living with us for a month now. 

D has been less than thrilled about K, but I don’t really understand. It’s not like I got married right after her mom died. K has been coming up to me, complaining about how D is being rude to her. I think this is completely unacceptable, as K is going to be an adult in D’s life, she should be shown some respect. I have not raised my daughter to be disrespectful to adults.

I talked to D about how she was acting and she acted like I was being the unreasonable one. She was upset about me getting married and does not like my new wife. I admit in the argument that ensued that I got quite frustrated, as did D. She was upset that I “took K’s side”, even though I want the important girls in my life to get along. I eventually ended up sending her to her room.

Now my former in laws have been blowing up my phone. I believe I am in the right, as does K, but thought it might be best to get an outside opinion. AITA?

"AITA for not altering my work task for my girlfriend I (32M) work for a consulting firm and my girlfriend (28F) is an engineer. 

She knows that her company uses the consulting firm I work at for various things.

Her company has recently provided some employee data to us and asked us to come up with a list of employees to lay off and told us what teams they want to keep, remove or merge.

Her team is set to be merged with another with a lower combined budget.

I have been tasked with the report for her department. She has told me to make sure she isn't laid off. I told her I couldn't possibly alter my work to save her and if it makes sense to lay her off i will have to do it. She'd get a decent severance if that were the case. I'm not allowed to inform her before her company does.

Honestly having looked at the data it makes sense to lay her off. She has a very high salary, and while she contributed the majority of lines of code in prior years, this year there are 2 other people with slightly more lines contributed so it shows reduction in productivity and she has a higher salary than the other two.

"AITA for dressing up as Batman for Halloween  I (34 m) am married to my wife (34 f) and we have to two kids together. Every year my wife's family does a family theme for Halloween that we all dress up as. This years theme is Barbie (any Barbie movie that there is) and my wife decided we would do Princess Charm School since it was her favorite Barbie movie growing up.
I hate this theme and would rather go as something more manly that won't embarrass me in front of my neighbors and friends. After work one night I stopped at the store and got myself a Batman costume instead. I let my wife believe I was going as Barbie's love interest from the movie and would arrive later to the party because I was working late, when in all reality I was getting ready to wear the Batman costume.
When I arrived at the party my wife's sisters happened to meet me by the door and got mad a me for wearing this costume. I explained that I didn't like the theme so I chose my own. At that point my wife had found us and started yelling about how selfish I was and how this is the one time a year that she gets to let loose and have fun with the theme. She told me to leave and I drove to a friends house and am spending the night out of anger.
All of her family is blowing up my phone telling me how selfish I am and calling me every name in the book. I blocked them and told my wife I needed a couple days to cool down. 

As I thought about it more, I can see how I was being a little selfish and should have stuck with the theme. But, I don't think I'm the A-hole for sticking to my own beliefs and having free will in this relationship. Reddit AITA?

"AITA For asking my friends girlfriend why she would date my friend since he is overweight, short and unattractive (no offense)? Just to make things clear, I do not have feelings for this girl nor do I have anything against my friend (I mean we are friends so I obviously don’t). I was legit just curious why she would date him considering all the negative aspects he has and also because I am really worried about him which I’ll mention in the post.

So my friend and this girl \[both 17\]  were secretly dating for 4 months and revealed it to us not too long ago. I was legit shocked that my friend managed to get a girlfriend, especially a girl like this one who is honestly hot af. Why? Well, no offense to him but he is short (173 cm/5 ft 8 in),  unattractive (he has acne all over his face) is slightly overweight, shy to talk to girls, etc… so I was curious how he managed to get her.

I felt like it was inappropriate to ask her a question like that but curiosity got the best of me. Well… at first she asked me why I’d ask that and when I told her the reason she. lost.  her.  shit. She told me he is in no way short (I looked at the average human height by country and he is) or unattractive (meh.. I guess looks are subjective so whatever) and that it’s not ok for me to be asking such questions. I was preparing to end this convo with her but then she THREATENED ME that she is going to tell my friend about the conversation we had as she doesn’t want her boyfriend to be next to toxic people (Wtf? She is overreacting right? I just asked a question). I told her she should cool the fuck down which ended up making her angrier and then I told her that he will not believe her as she has no proof (unless she somehow stumbles across this post which is highly unlikely if it won’t gain traction) and that he would believe a friend of 2 years over a “girlfriend” of 4 months. Also just to make things clear, I am not scared that he will do something to me (I am bigger and stronger anyways) but I don’t want our friendship to end because something silly like this.

HOLD UP! DO NOT COMMENT YET!

Before you guys scream that I am a big asshole I want to let you guys know that the only good aspect he has is that his parents are rich and I am worried that he is getting used by this girl (most likely). I am honestly doing this for him because I am worried about him. Ok now you can judge.

"AITAH for pointing out to my girlfriend that her cat has obvious signs of dwarfism I (23 M) recently moved in with my girlfriend (23F) and she has 2 cats. One is a calico and is built completely normal, which piqued my interest with the second cat. Cat number 2, Cannoli, has very short front legs compared to cat number 1 (Ravioli). Cannoli has always kept her distance from me, ever since my girlfriend first got her, so I’ve never really noticed her leg size. Recently though Ravioli has begun to like me so I hang out with her a lot. Cannoli however has only recently started warming up to me and standing in the same room with me, which is when I noticed that her front legs looked a little short. When I brought it up to my girlfriend she defended Cannoli, saying that she had perfectly proportional legs. Now I don’t mind if the cat is perfectly proportional, however I think that when it comes to a cat that’s a mutt it’s kind of fun to figure out what breed it is. I discovered that there’s something called a munchkin cat and that mixed cats can have that in them. When showing that to my girlfriend she was not amused and continued defending the perfection of Cannoli’s leg heights. I’ll leave pictures in this of the cat so I can maybe get some opinions because it’s causing a regular debate in our house lol.

UPDATE:
I now see that I was the asshole in this situation, however I think the comment section needed to chill a bit lmao. My girlfriend wasn’t too upset about my post when she found it, but when she read all the comments about how “fat” cannoli was she was very sad. I now see that cannoli is a normal cat with just some shorter front legs, but that doesn’t mean she’s a munchkin. I did get a couple vets in here with different opinions though so maybe I’ll look into it at a vet one day lol. Thank you for sharing your opinions but please stop saying cannoli is fat.

"AITA for selling my concert ticket without telling the friend I was supposed to go with? Hi, I’ve wanted to get closure on this for a while on whether I was the AH in this situation.



A few years ago, my friend (we’ll call her Sam) offered to let me rent a room in her house when I was a bit down on my luck. It was in a new city I hadn’t lived in before so I kind of saw it as a new opportunity and moved in within a month.

Sam and I had known each other for 10 years at this point, so it wasn’t like I was moving in with a stranger.
I wasn’t expecting Sam and I to do everything together, and she’s never been a great friend to begin with, but she pulled away a lot after I moved in.

Within a year of me living there, Sam had a falling out with an old friend from her hometown who had come to visit a few times. Sam began bonding with another girl from back home who had issues with this (former) friend as well. Before I knew it, this girl (let’s call her Jessica) was interviewing for jobs and planning to move in with us. 
After Jessica moved in, she and Sam became inseparable. I won’t lie that I was jealous because while Sam and I had been friends for over 10 years, we had never been this close.

A few months prior to Jessica moving in, Sam and I bought tickets to a big concert, one that you had to wait in a virtual queue to get tickets for. We were very lucky and got floor tickets; she bought them and I paid her back AND she sent me the ticket on Ticketmaster, so it was in my possession. 

By the time the concert came around, I didn’t feel close to Sam at all and I didn’t feel like I could enjoy myself if we went to the concert together. We had attended a different concert together a month before and the entire time, she kept looking to where Jessica’s seat was (she had to buy a separate ticket from a reseller because we bought these awhile back as well). I could tell she’d rather be next to her and it kind of soured my experience.

The week of the concert, I resold my ticket for a lot of money, but I didn’t mention it to either of them. I had been working basically every night and didn’t schedule time off to go to the concert anyway.
Sam didn’t mention anything about the concert until two days before because she wanted to know if I’d like to get an upgrade. I lied and told her I’d think about it. She messaged me again the next day and that’s when I confessed that I sold the ticket because I didn’t want to go anymore.
She was LIVID and acted like I was supposed to ask Jessica before I sold it to someone random. Apparently Jessica had been going around doing Uber to make some extra money to attend this concert as well. I’m not sure if she intended to buy my ticket or what, but they were both pissed at me and things didn’t really recover after that.

"AITA for making my girlfriend go through the bins? I (30M) have been dating Georgia (26F) for about a year now so we decided to take the plunge and move in together. I moved into her flat because it’s bigger and more convenient for me to get to work. As with moving in, we moved all my stuff over and both decided to downsize on our possessions to make the space a bit more comfortable. We’ve both been going through our things and throwing out stuff we don’t need or look at anymore. The general rule is that if it’s been more than a month and it’s not been used/though about, it goes.

It’s no secret to me or anyone who knows Georgia that she likes tea. Whenever we go on a trip, she likes to buy a small tea caddy or packet of loose leaf to take home with her. She has a photo album of all the teas she has drunk - it’s filled with packets/photos of caddies which are all dated and reviewed. I’ve seen several of her albums and she’s talked me through them. Personally, I’m happy she has a hobby but i’m not that interested. I listen politely and that’s that.

Sometimes when one of us is working and the other has the day off, the one with the day off sorts  through possessions. Georgia happened to be working last weekend so I was tasked with clearing the flat. I found a big box in her cellar (it’s not a proper one, more of a cupboard since it’s in the flat) full of tea caddies. I, not thinking, threw them out because she has photos of the caddies which are dated so I figured she didn’t need the actual caddies anymore as they were right at the back of the cellar. I still kept the box they were in for storage but the caddies went into a bag and into the bins outside along with other things. 

Well today, we both went through the cellar together since I didn’t get through all of it. Long story short, she picked up the box, realised it was empty and freaked out. I tried to explain that it was an accident because she had the photos so I thought she didn’t need them and I didn’t want to bother her at work. She was really upset understandably so but once she learned i’d put them in the bin, she asked me to get them back since they hadn’t been emptied before. I refused because I’m not going to root through bins and we agreed to downsize on possessions. She said it didn’t matter because she didn’t want to throw them away in the first place and that I “need” to get them back. When I didn’t, she decided to go into the bins and look through every single bag. She did get them back but is now not talking to me because I made her go through them even though it was her own choice anyway.

"AITA for using my nephew to see if my sister-in-law is my father-in-law’s daughter? My husband (38) and I (M 35) helped my FIL get the answer to a question he’s been wondering for over 40 years: is my daughter, my daughter?

Quick backstory, my FIL only found out my SIL (now 46) was born 8-months after her birth. He was away in the military and was called back when MIL told her family it was FIL. He has been unsure about his paternity ever since. This was back in the 80s, so no DNA testing available to find out. FIL has brought this up with SIL once, many years ago, and she adamantly said that she doesn’t want to find out, even if he wants to know.

I suggested we use 23&amp;Me and give one to her son, 22 at the time, and one to FIL and see if they matched. They didn’t.  

Unfortunately, the nephew happened to be staying over at SIL’s place for the weekend, the same time as the results came to him by email. She saw them and asked what was going on. She called FIL and he told her what had happened and that my husband and I had helped. She got understandably upset and accused us of destroying her life and doing it to claim FIL’s inheritance all for ourselves.

She’s not talking to us and says we were abusing her son by using him in that manner.

There was much talk back and forth and FIL wanted to see how SIL would react to getting an official test done to rule out any potential mistakes. If she said yes and that she just wants them to be father and daughter, then he wouldn’t bother and forget about the whole thing. However, if she mentions money/his will, he will go through with it.

SIL screamed “oh so you’re just going to cut me out of your will then and leave me with nothing?!”. FIL felt he was just a big bag of money to her and nothing more, so he proceeded with the court-ordered DNA testing, which gave the same result as 23&amp;Me. He has also had his official records changed so that he is legally no longer her father.

I knew that going behind SIL’s back isn’t morally right, however, she would never help FIL get the answers he wants. We had hoped we could have sat with the information for some time before approaching her. Her son is an adult, and we didn’t tell him about family relationship stuff, just that it could be cool to see where your DNA is from on a map.

"AITA for thinking my friend who is usually the designated driver would be the DESIGNATED DRIVER? What happened last night is rocking my friendship group so I need to know if I’m in the wrong for this. My friend group consists of 3 girls: myself 22f, Liz 23f and lia 22f (fake name). We’ve been really close since freshman year of college and we’ve always had the same dynamic when we go out. Liz and I get hammered and lia is the designated driver because she doesn’t do drugs or drink. It’s literally been like this since we were 18. 
Lia’s birthday was recently and we were all really busy to do anything special. Last minute all three of us got invited to a kick back lia’s boyfriend’s friend was hosting and it worked out that we all could go. The friend told us to be there by 6 but Liz and I wanted to go around 8 because we didn’t want to go to a party early. I should have realized what was going on because lia’s boyfriend kept texting her to drive over earlier and he would pay for an Uber to come get Liz and I later. I told Lia to just wait for us to get ready. 
Lia drove and we arrive around 9 because we wanted to pick up some alcohol. I was so surprised and kind of embarrassed to find out that  the kick back was a surprise party for lia organized by her boyfriend . I felt kinda bad because apparently the boyfriend was trying to get in contact with us to tell us about the party but Liz and I had blocked his number prior to this whole thing because he dropped us as friends earlier this year. 
The party was really nice tho. We kinda just left lia with her boyfriend because he doesn’t like us very much. I feel like he should have tried harder to contact us so we could at least got her there on time and brought a present like everyone else. 
It’s around 11PM when liz and I want to go cuz it’s getting boring and like usual we are pretty wasted so we go to find lia. She’s all over her man but we say excuse us and tell her we want to leave. SHES SAYS ILL SEE YOU GUYS LATER THANKS FOR COMING??? Like did you not bring us here??? I tell her that she’s literally our designated driver and she could just drive us home and come back. She starts apologizing and starts saying she’ll do it but her bf like gets mad at us. He tells us to order an uber but we really don’t trust Ubers when we get drunk. I did feel bad because it was her birthday but like we were 30 mins from my place tho.
Her boyfriend ends up driving us back and cussing us out the whole drive and he got really hurtful saying we were bad friends and taking advantage of lia. Longest 30 minutes of my damn life. We thank him and he ignores us. 
Anyway Liz and I end up going out again later that night to a local bar with this guy liz is seeing. And she posts a ig story of us there like an idiot.

Lia is not replying to us but we are literally mad at her because she didn’t hold up her role when we go out.  
AITA?

Edit: please stop praising Lia’s bf. One surprise party doesn’t reverse the hell he’s caused her. He’s not a good person and we’ve been trying to break them up for so long. This is why we (liz and I) avoid him the best we can. ",Asshole,189cq3t
"AITA for refusing to pay my parents rent Hi reddit! I (19F) graduated earlier this year and made the decision to take a gap year before I continue on studying next fall. This wasn’t a spur of the moment decision. I have talked with my mom about this for years after taking her recommendation to take a gap year. After struggling with a really heavy depression for years, I got my first real job last winter and have been working there since. Its a part time position of only 3h a week and even though it was perfect for when I was in school, since graduating I have been actively looking for another job so I can save up some extra cash for when I do move away to University.

In the midst of me applying for jobs so I could save more money every month (since it was difficult to save enough on my current paychecks) my mom called me and explained how she and my dad, who are separated and live apart, wanted me to start paying them rent to live at home. This really caught me off guard and I broke down completely. Not once had she or my dad ever brought this up to me before. I asked why they wanted me to pay to live at home when she was the one who told me not to move right away after graduation and to live at home for an extra year, and she said it was money I would pay them to cover the cost of food and groceries whilst I live at home. This would have been a very reasonable point if it weren’t for the fact that I have been buying and making my own food for months. The majority of my paychecks go to groceries since I have always been very particular about my diet and decided that just being in charge of own grocery shopping would be easier than asking for a separate dish that they would have to cook. I explained all of this to her, asked why they want me to pay them for buying groceries for me when I already use my own money for my everyday meals, and she just dismissed me and said they always cook and I should pay for the food that is handed to me. I can’t be unreasonable for refusing to pay for something I don’t even eat right? And yes, I tell them ahead that I will be making my own lunch or dinner and I don’t need them to cook for me so they don’t.

So, am I the asshole for telling my mom I won’t pay her or my dad ”grocery money” for as long as I live at home since I already use my money to buy groceries for myself?

(edit) To specify, I mainly live at my dads place simply due to personal preference and since my parents are on good terms, I would be paying one of them but they'd share it if that makes sense. They talked about this together but my mother was the one who brought it up to me! She also added that this was so I'd get a push to get another job even though I have explained on multiple occasions that I have been actively applying for jobs for weeks and recently got another one. I also told her that I could move out and get my own place for 9 months before moving again but was told I really should stay at home since they thought that would be better.",Asshole,1nqjfrb
"AITA for telling some they’re “medium ugly”? So I’m 19M and currently stationed at a new duty station after finishing basic a few months back. The other day I ran into this dude I went through basic with—let’s call him Jones (20M)—randomly on post. Wasn’t expecting it, but whatever. We weren’t super tight during training, but we knew each other, shared the same smoke sessions, and got chewed out together enough times to at least be cool.

We start talking, catching up, and he seems chill, so we decide to hit the McDonald’s on base real quick to grab some food. We’re just sitting there eating, shooting the shit, and then out of nowhere, Jones starts hyping himself up like he’s some kind of military thirst trap. Says, “Bro, I don’t know what it is, but I’ve been getting crazy attention from girls lately. Must’ve leveled up or something since basic.”

I just laughed and said, “Dude, I always thought you were, like, medium ugly. Maybe the uniform’s helping out.”

He stares at me for a second like I just told him his mom’s ugly too, then kind of shuts down. Barely touches his food after that, mumbles something about having to go do laundry or whatever, and bounces early. I finish my fries and move on with my day.

Next day, I hear through one of the guys from our training group (who’s at a different unit but still on post) that Jones is talking trash. Saying I was “disrespectful” and made him feel like crap for no reason. Apparently now I’m a ""cocky asshole"" because I didn’t kiss his ass and pretend he’s hot.

Here’s the thing: I don’t think I’m the asshole because it really wasn’t that deep. It wasn’t meant to hurt his feelings—it was just a dumb offhand comment. We roasted each other constantly in basic. That’s the culture. You get called every name in the book, your haircut gets clowned, your face, your boots, your breathing—nothing’s sacred. “Medium ugly” is tame by comparison.

Plus, he set himself up. If you’re gonna sit there bragging about how girls are all over you now, you better be ready for someone to hit you with a little reality. I didn’t say he was hideous, I didn’t come at him sideways, I just didn’t inflate his ego. Not my job.

&amp;#x200B;

I 30m lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago. My mom 50f went on a fancy cruise 9 months after he died using the money from his life insurance. After this my mom never talked about my dad anymore. She would go out drinking with friends and started talking with people she hadn't seen in years.

At the time I thought my mom's actions were inappropriate for a woman who had just lost her husband of 30 years but didn't say anything. I talked to my sister ""Anna"" 28f about my mom, but she just told me that if our mom didn't build herself a new life she would fall into a depression.

Well last week I couldn't take it anymore. My mom started seeing this new guy and apparently they have been seeing eachother for 6 months. She invited my siblings and I over to meet the guy ""Greg"" 54m. During the dinner my mom acted like nothing was wrong and was smiling the whole time. It really hurt to see just how quickly she moved on from my dad and I just felt disgusted with her.

After Greg went home my mom called me out for making him feel unwelcome and said I could have at least said hello to him. I told her I was grossed out at the thought of her bringing random guys to my dad's house and at her age she shouldn't be dating anyway. 

My mom said ""do you expect me to have no life after your dad passed away"". This really hurt me since it's only been 2 years since he died. I yelled that I expected her to at least act like she cared. My mom started crying and then my brother ""Aaron"" 27m kicked me out of the house. (He still lives with my mom at my dad's old house).

I felt bad because I lost my temper but I don't really regret what I said in the moment. My mom has tried to reach out to me to talk but I've been avoiding her calls because I'm not ready to talk to her.

"AITA for buying pizza for my cousin’s daughter immediately after the other cousin's daughter left? So for context   
  
My cousin (39M) lives in Saudi Arabia with his wife and daughter (9F). His wife recently passed away, and he came back to India with his daughter for the cremation and rituals. Soon after, he got very sick himself, hospitalized for 2 months on a ventilator.   
  
His home in India is in a different state from ours, so my mother and I went to visit him. We stayed at his house with his parents and his daughter, 9F

During the visit, my other cousin (34F) came to visit him too with her daughter (5F) and her parents. So there were two kids in the house: 9F, who was grieving her mother and whose father was in the hospital, and 5F.

34F and family couldn't stay long because of her job and the kid's school, so they were going to leave before us

On the afternoon they were supposed to leave, 9F refused to come for lunch multiple times because she was busy drawing. I eventually snatched her pen, which slightly ruined her drawing, and in response, she drew on my brand-new t-shirt. Now let me say this: the kid IS a bit of a brat, grieving or not. Naturally, I got angry and yelled at her.   
  
Later that day, we dropped 34F and her family at the airport. The house felt empty. I felt bad for yelling at 9F, so I sat with her a little, talked to her, and decided to buy her pizza to reconcile.

The next day, 34F and her family found out I bought pizza for 9F the same day they left and got upset, accusing me of showing partiality or favouritism because I didn’t do anything like that for their daughter, 5F, while they were there. Apparently, it would have been fine if I had bought the pizza a few days later, but doing it the same day they left was an issue; apparently, 5F felt left out. They haven't been talking to us ever since.

"AITA for wanting my fiancee to not “wield” my daughter My (M24) fiancée F (20) has a close relationship with my daughter it is usually very sweet, but sometimes man handles her and even calls her “shitass”(!?). She’s only four but she really loves my fiancé like a mother. Sometimes when she’s looking for attention my fiancée will wield her in the air (over her head) and say something like “get wielded, idiot” 
my daughter really seems to enjoy this, but I worry that it is unsafe and will eventually result in injury. 

About two weeks ago I asked my fiancée if she would stop wielding our daughter, who is mind you four years old, and she said she loves it, and it would be damaging to their relationship if she stopped. My daughter had to get an emergency surgery, unrelated to the “wielding“ and my fiancé, and even before her official recovery was done, I saw my fiancé wielding our daughter in the air. (luckily she wasn’t hurt) I said to stop at least until her recovery is done, but my fiancé reiterated how damaging it would be for their relationship. We’ve been arguing about this for the past three days and I’ve been sleeping on the couch. Am I the asshole?

"AITA for confronting my boyfriend after he gave away part of our baby’s birthday money and refused to pay me back? I (22F) have a daughter turning 1 this week. I recently started working again, but before that, I was unemployed and surviving off inheritance money from my late father, who was a landowner. It’s not a steady income, but I’d get rent payments here and there. I used some of that money to start lending out small loans at 20% interest. Over time, I turned $700 into over $7,000, which became our main support since my boyfriend (23M) doesn’t have a job.

He used to work but was fired for signing in and leaving early. He fishes, so food isn’t the issue — I cover everything else, including our baby’s needs. I’d been saving as much as I could for her birthday.

Where I'm from, we can apply for financial help from MPs. If accepted, they'd give you a task and pay you when it’s done — we call it a “bid.” My boyfriend got two: one for $3,000 (meant for the party), and another for $1,000 (which he said was for himself).

He gave half of the $3,000 to his mom to “lightly” shop for food, even though we only needed a few things. I was covering all the other expenses: decorations, clothes, etc. I had also lent him over $2,000 over time, even after telling him I couldn’t anymore. He promised to pay me back once he got the second bid. When I asked for it, he told me to “mind my own business” and that I already had my own money.

I’m furious because I sacrificed so much to save for this party while he acts like money isn’t a problem. Now I’m short, he’s refusing to repay me, and I’m left to figure everything out alone.

"AITA for having a problem? I’m 45m, wife is 43F, been married almost 18 years with 4 daughters. 

My wife for the past ten years or so has planned a get-away trip each year for herself alone to travel about 6-7 hours away to spend a long weekend with her gay guy friend to hang out with all his gay guy friends having a weekend of drinking and bar hopping and laying around a pool with people known for doing hard drugs. 

I know the guy (one of her childhood friends) and he’s 100% gay although they act very lovey toward each other and jokingly act as if they were a couple; which specifically doesn’t bother me that much as I know him and understand the humor they find in it (there are significant physical difference reasons why they find it funny). 

The problem that I have expressed is how it hurts me and embarrasses me that she partakes in this weekend of whatever she’s doing and how she refuses to answer her phone or respond to texts because “it defeats the purpose of it being a getaway when she keeps having to respond to home”. I feel embarrassed that my wife enjoys spending a weekend away with a group of almost exclusively gay guys. 

Am I the Asshole for telling her that I am uncomfortable with this trip and have been every year she’s gone? When I bring it up it always results in us fighting and a few years she has backed out of the trip but other years she has gone specifically to be defiant and hurtful. This year we fought about it and she cancelled. 

She tells me I shouldn’t worry because they’re all gay and that she deserves a weekend away from being a SAHM and that I should support her going.

Full disclosure, our relationship hasn’t been the best for several years. We’ve done therapy,and attempted to work through many problems over the years. It this one seems to be a hill she’s mostly willing to fight on. 

I don’t specifically think she’s taking the weekend as a hall pass, but I fully expect that there will be behavior that I would be embarrassing for me and I would not approve of happening. I feel that it’s inappropriate and she should be open to taking my feelings on the matter in to account.

"WIBTA if I asked my sister not to include my siblings in her will? I know how this sounds, so bear with me. We from the same parents, but they’re older (22, 20, 19 and 17 years), and I was like an only child. I only formed a real relationship with them after college.

Oldest sister married a successful man 20 years older. She worked with him. When he turned 60, they retired (she was 40). They live off pensions, social security, and interest income, and have $2 million. They have no kids, and their health is failing. His docs say he has less than a year to live. She has cancer, has about the same.

Brother and his wife retired in their 50’s after selling her family’s business (inherited when her parents died), and they travel, and have 2 houses in the US and 1 in Italy. They have 3 kids.

Next sister’s husband is an exec for a big company. They travel with my brother a lot, and have 2 homes. Two kids.

Last sister is widowed. Her husband made over $1 million/yr. When he died, she told us he left her with about $10 million. She volunteers, chairs a running club, and audits college classes to keep busy. She has 2 kids.

I’ve struggled. In 2014 I got promoted. Then, in 2015, the company I was at got bought, and I was let go. I found a lower job with a pay cut. I was close to my 2015 salary when the pandemic shut down the new employer.

I found a FT job that was horrible, and was lucky to then find another job. I’m employed, but making less than 9 years ago. I contribute to my 401K, and I’m frugal. I drive a 2015 car, and I have some savings. This company is being bought, so my position will likely go away in 12-18 mos.

My oldest sis made me executor of their estate, and I’m happy to do it. Their will says everything’s split between her siblings. I think about how $500,000 won’t change my brothers and sisters lives; just a little windfall to toss in with the rest. For me? Life changing, but the full amount would mean that I can stress a whole lot less about money. I could live the life I’ve always watched them live.

I know I sound entitled and selfish. I’m grateful to be in the will at all, and I know I’m so, so much more fortunate than so many. It’s very hard to be so much younger and so much less successful than my sibs are/were. I ended up with a family full of multi-millionaires, and I fear I’ll never get even halfway to the point they are. I’ll watch my nieces and nephews inherit their parents’ money, and I’ll just live my modest life. Jealousy is horrible.

I’m thinking of asking my sister about the will, and if she’s thought of any of this. I am scared to be too blunt, and I might even chicken out. It feels wrong to ask her to exclude the others, but the money just won’t mean very much to them – they’re all wealthier than she is!

"AITA for getting 3 co-workers fired for making a hot list? A bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on Friday after work. Everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). I go to the bathroom, and as I am about to exit the hall to the bathroom I hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and I did.

I overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing this morning, and now I feel terrible.

I hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn't think they should be fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person who reported them, and I've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". I'm wondering if I should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time I didn't feel comfortable doing that. I especially feel bad because I had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.

INFO 1: It was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinks

INFO 2: A lot of people are insisting that I am upset because I was low on the list. I tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments I feel like I have to address it. I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I hate that I even have to write this

"WIBTA for getting rid of my parents’ outdoor cat colony? My parents have moved out of our familial home in favor of something smaller, although they still own this house and my siblings and I have moved back in and are paying the mortgage. The problem is that they also left behind about 20 cats, ranging from friendly to feral, all outside exclusively. They are all spayed and neutered to their credit—however, they have completely destroyed the local wildlife. Growing up in this home I remember so many different birds that used to always be present in the backyard, which is now devoid of any wildlife. Still everyday I’m finding dead mice, shrews, moles, squirrels, and whatever birds are unfortunate enough to wander onto our land. Most are barely eaten and obviously killed for sport—all of the cats are fed well.

Today really pushed me over the edge. I noticed a birds nest above my door, and today was the first time I heard the pips from babies. I was so excited about it and thought to myself how I’d be able to protect the nest better. I left my house for two hours and came back to the mother dead in front of my door, not eaten at all, just killed. The nest was obviously disturbed and blood was present around it. All babies were eaten.

Ive already brought this up to my parents numerous times and they do not see any issue and aren’t going to do anything about it. Mom says I should be grateful for the free pest control. They’re already beginning to accrue an entirely new cat colony at their new house. I want to post some of the nicer cats on Facebook for anyone who wants a mouser for their barn or something similar, some of them would even be excellent house cats. However, we already have 5 indoor cats and are not looking to add to that number. Any cats that I can’t rehome, I want to bring to a shelter, and I don’t care if it’s kill or no kill. It is so unfair to every other living creature anywhere on our property, which used to be a quiet oasis of butterflies, birds, deer, etc. Now all that’s here is the faint aroma of cat piss everywhere you go.

My sister says I have no right to do anything because they’re not my animals, and I understand what she’s saying. But we are taking care of them and this house and are ultimately responsible for this land. They don’t all need to go, but a considerable number.

"AITA for calling an ill’s person performance “underwhelming”? Okay, I'm posting this here because I thought I was right, but now I'm thinking I might be a horrible person and not realizing it.

I was hanging out with two of my friends, and we were talking about a certain celebrity and how they always seem to do the bare minimum during their performances. My friends are not big fans of this celebrity but do follow their career and know more about them than I do. They told me that this person has a condition that doesn't allow them to make great efforts. I told them that, if this was the case, this celebrity should not have chosen that career because it's really demanding, and that if I were a fan paying big bucks for the show (they're VERY popular), I would be pissed to get an underwhelming performance because one member of the crew can't keep up with the rest.

One of my friends then told me, ""So you're saying that if someone is ill, they are not allowed to work in their dream job?"" (or something like that), and I said that if it was a hobby then sure, do as you please, but if you're charging people pricey tickets for a certain level of performance, you should make sure you can live up to those expectations or you're basically scamming them.

My friends told me that's a horrible thing to say and that anyone should be allowed to work in what they want, even if they are ill or disabled. I told them that only if they can meet the expectations for said job despite being ill or disabled. They told me again that I sounded like an asshole.

"WIBTA for telling my kids they are no longer welcome in my home? So I(53F) and my boyfriend 'david'(51M) have moved in together. My youngest daughter 'Lori'(21F) lives with us. My three older children have been moved out for years, but live nearby. Their father died almost a year ago.

When my boyfriend moved in he expressed discomfort with having people in his home all the time. My older kids would come to visit Lori, and David could hear them all in the basement all of a sudden, in his space. David has some really bad social anxiety and didn't like not knowing. So I asked my three olders if they could call and let David know they were coming before they came in the house. Since then, they've stopped coming over all together, or so I thought. I really wanted them to get to know David, so I'm disappointed they're not making an effort now that they have a chance interact with him (Calling to let him know they're coming).

Lori has been acting out in ways she never did before. She's ignoring me, snapping at me, not making an effort to do *any* chores. She keeps accusing me of not communicating with her, when really she's just ignoring what I am saying. She didn't 'know' that David was moving in with us, (even though she was told) because she just isn't listening at all. This is very out of character for her.

Well, last week I found out that my older kids were coming over when David and I were out of the house, without letting us know at all. This feels very frustrating and violating. David is hurt and frustrated because he feels like they are being sneaky. WIBTA for telling my older children they are no longer welcome at all? I would still see them other places, just not my home.

Edit: It was my home and David moved in with me. I didn't realize that was going to be important, sorry.

Edit 2: The kids father was not a good man. I wouldn't say they're grieving about him as much as you're all saying. I don't think I'm rushing things with David, I have a lot of wasted time to make up for. I think the kids should be happy for me and understand the change in status quo.  


Edit 3: Wow, that's a lot of negativity over the fact I'm respecting my boyfriends anxieties. He doesn't like a bunch of people he barely knows in his house without letting him know. Lori can have her siblings over, fine, but maybe she should revisit her communication issues before complicating things. My kids have been actively cold towards David, whose doing a lot of good for me.

"AITA for not paying my MIL after she fed my dog her expensive food? I asked my mother-in-law to take care of my dog for around 10-11 days because we wanted to go on a trip. And she said yes, **but only to part of that time**. So I organized that **a friend would take Masha for the rest of the time (separate food bag would be ordered to her place)**, another would drive her to the first friend,  and for a few days she’d stay in a dog hotel. It was a lot, but I sotred it out.

I brought my dog with all of her stuff, her toys, her food, etc, saying that food might not be enough for the whole stay (1 day short, at most -- I measured out six scoops — one scoop per day — and there was even a bit left at the bottom of the bag, so I brought everything. I figured that if she was a bit more generous with the portions, it might end up being short by a day or half a day, so I decided to give her heads up. Not a big deal, since six scoops should’ve been enough for six days), so she should just let me know when it's finished so I could order some more (I guess that was just me being precautionery).

While we were on the trip, a couple of days in, she says that she doesn't want Masha to go to a friend and then to a hotel or whatever and that she will take care of her for the whole time. And that would obviously be a good thing except it took a lof effort get everything organized. It pissed me off, but I said nothing.

When we got back, my MIL told me the food I left finished after 3 days, even tough it should last at least 6. She said she had to feed Masha her own dog’s food instead and wanted me to pay her back. That made me really mad because I specifically asked her to tell me when the food ran out. She argumented that both dogs had to eat the same thing, which I sorta get, but she could’ve just fed them separately if she wanted to. Masha’s food isn’t expensive, but my MIL’s dog only eats one brand that costs like three times as much. I didn’t want to say something petty like, “Well, I bring snacks for them all the time and don’t ask you for money,” so **I offered to buy her a new bag of the same food instead of giving her cash.** She couldn’t tell me how much Masha ate, though, and honestly, it kinda felt like she just wanted the money, not the food replaced.

At the same time she did us a favor by taking care of Masha, and I do appreciate that. Still, the whole situation left me pissed and unsure if I was being fair.

For context, my MIL is pretty self-centered and never really sees when she’s in the wrong, but I also know I tend to overreact when it comes to her, so I’d really appreciate some outside opinions on this.

EDIT: It’s honestly sad to see that most people are making this about money — or about the exact amount of dog food and when it was delivered. That was never the point. I would have paid any amount if it had been about my dog’s wellbeing — that’s not even up for debate. It feels like some people are projecting their own bad experiences of not being able to rely on others onto this story, hiding behind nitpicky details. What bothers me is the principle behind it: calling something a favor and then turning it into a transaction afterward. To me, that’s what ruins the sense of trust and mutual support between people who are supposed to care about each other. I wasn’t trying to save money; I was trying to have things done the way we agreed. Maybe that’s what some people don’t get — it’s not about the money, it’s about respect and boundaries.",Asshole,1o2gxnx
"AITA for favoring my son over my daughter and now asking her to help him out? 
I'm (50F) a mother of two, and I’m realizing now that I haven’t always been a great parent, especially to my daughter. My husband (55M) and I have a son (30M) and a daughter (28F). When they were growing up, I favored my son because, to be honest, he seemed like the one who would go far. He got great grades, won awards, and was always the ""promising"" child. My daughter, on the other hand, was more into writing and making weird little films with her friends. I didn’t understand it and, at the time, I didn’t think it would lead to a stable future, so we didn’t really support her creative passions.

When it came time for college, we paid for our son to go because we thought it was the best investment. We refused to pay for our daughter to attend film school, thinking it was a waste of money. I thought I was making the practical choice, but looking back, I realize how unfair I was. I didn’t take her dreams seriously, and I know I hurt her because of it.

Fast forward 10 years, and the situation is nothing like what I expected. Our son got kicked out of college for partying too much and hasn’t been able to hold down a job since. He’s still living with us and can’t afford to move out. Meanwhile, our daughter has become really successful. She’s a popular creator on YouTube, making original short horror films, with a huge following and solid income from sponsorships and other opportunities. I never saw that coming.

Now, my husband and I are struggling financially, and our son needs help getting back on his feet. We asked our daughter if she could help out by paying for an apartment for him, just to give him a chance to get on his own. She got really upset and refused. She told us that we always favored him and never supported her, which is true. She also said something that hit me hard—she believes if she helps her brother, he’ll just use the money to party and waste the opportunity, like he always has.

She doesn’t trust him to actually get his life together, and I understand why. He hasn’t shown much responsibility over the years, and I’m sure she feels like she’s being asked to bail him out while we never gave her the same kind of support.

I know I screwed up as a parent. I feel guilty about how I treated her growing up, but I also feel responsible for my son, who’s clearly struggling. I just want to help him get on track, but maybe asking my daughter was the wrong move.

"AITA for yelling at my ""friend""? Hey reddit. I feel like I'm justified in this but based on a few arguments with friends I figured I'd post here.

Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we're all in a group chat together. We all have a kind of edgy sense of humor, and we end up toeing the line or making jokes at the expense of other people quite a bit. More often than not these are jokes that end up using ""slurs"" or other language that's deemed offensive today. For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.

One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we'd stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We've all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again. The one guy continued to tell us to stop, and say that it was wrong for us to use language like that, but it felt kinda playful like he didn't really mean it so we brushed it off.

Well, I guess it was less playful because he reported us to the faculty of the school we go to. We all had to have meetings with somebody from the office of discipline. We felt really hurt and betrayed by our so called ""friend"". We basically got him in a room and asked him why he felt the need to report us and he tried to deny it, but then said that he wished he DID report us because the language we used and the jokes we made were ""sickening"". This is where I kind of lost my temper and started yelling. I told him that he was way out of line for reporting us to the office, that he was a snake for it. I have a scholarship and a job offer and he literally gambled it all over something as little as a few curse words or dark jokes- JOKES- about his girlfriend. He told me that he knew we weren't really joking and that we deserved what we got. We're still in college, we have our whole lives ahead of us. It isn't fair of him to risk my scholarship and my future career over a few mistakes we made when we were kids.

We haven't talked to him since. We're basically his only friends so nobody knows what he's been up to. I was complaining about the whole situation to a friend from high school when he said that I was an ass for yelling, that I should have just stayed calm about it. AITA?

"AITA for telling my brother that he shouldn’t move our other brother out of state? I (30M) have 2 brothers, Grant (35) and Cole (15M). Cole is technically our half-brother, but we never use that terminology. Grant and I’s father died when we were young. Cole’s father has never been in the picture. 

Admittedly, our mom has never been emotionally present. She wasn’t the kindest. I know she loves us and she had a hard life, but life was not easy to her. Grant really raised Cole because even when our mom wasn’t working, she wasn’t “there”, if that makes sense. 10 years ago, Grant married Molly. She’s basically raised him. Cole spends a lot of time at their house, multiple days a week. They tried for years to have a baby and only succeeded last year, so I know for many years, Molly and Grant considered Cole their son.

In the past year, our mother has been trying to do better but often gets frustrated with Cole as he still prefers going to Grant and Molly’s house. They allow it to go on, despite me telling them they should encourage Cole to have a relationship with our mother. They say they want to support him emotionally.

Grant recently got a job opportunity on the opposite side of the country. He and Molly told my mom they want to bring Cole. They’ll set up in a good school, make sure he gets into a good college, makes friends and that he won’t lose his support system. Cole wants go. My mom agreed to let him go and says she’ll sign over guardianship. But this is tearing her apart. She feels Cole isn’t even trying. I’ve heard her cry far too much over this.

I confronted Grant and said he needs to tell Cole he can’t go. He’s killing our mother and isn’t giving her a chance. Grant said it’d be too dangerous if he regressed into his old ways. Molly was there and she said that they’ve basically raised Cole. Abandoning him would hurt him and he needs to come first. I said they have a real baby now, they don’t need to steal our brother from Mom. He’s not a consolation prize because they couldn’t have their own child for so long. 

Molly left the room. Grant asked me to leave. I tried to talk to Cole and tell him what he’s doing. He told me I have no clue what I’m talking about and to leave them alone. 

My mom is thankful I’m sticking up for her but Grant says I’m acting like a jerk. AITA?",Asshole,1dw3s80
"AITA for calling a school group chat instead of an ambulance? CONTEXT: I've been a type 1 diabetic since 10 y/o (currently 26F). I was diagnosed as autistic in 2024. I started studying in 2025, the institution and the head of career were aware of both medical diagnoses. English isn't my first language.

On 24/11, I went to practical classes without much issue aside from a high glycemia of 260 mg/dl, which I managed with insulin and drinking water until it went down to 198 mg/dl. The head of the career and my teacher at the moment insisted I go to the E.R., as I was very pale and with a headache. I insisted I was fine (I didn't feel other symptoms, and I admit I was stubborn about not missing classes,) but eventually, I agreed and left for home to change my uniform. 

After I arrived and changed to normal attire, I started having heavy nausea and severe pain in my legs, which came to a point where I couldn't breathe because my stomach acid burned my esophagus. I only thought of calling a friend who told me \*call me if you need anything\*, but this friend had her phone off, so I only thought of calling the group chat we shared in case she was around. I was really dizzy, two other classmates were trying to listen to me, but I could only mutter \*help please\*,\*hospital\*, and my friend's name (as she has a car). Eventually, that friend and another classmate managed to take me to the E.R., where they told me it wasn't a full-on DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), but there were some ketones making trouble. An IV and meds later, I was discharged home. 

My mother went to deliver my certificate, and she (and I) got scolded by the head of the career. This is what she told her: 1) It would have been problematic if I were to die in my classmates' arms, as it would be detrimental for their future careers. 2) I should have been smarter and called an ambulance instead of interrupting my classmates, instead of traumatizing them with my mess. 3) The incident must have been my fault since I'm a diabetic and I'm rarely seen eating or eating ''bad stuff''

I debate this last argument bc I don't have the economic means to be \*eating bad stuff\*, I follow the meals I bring from home over very stretched schedules (I eat very little), and the only time she saw me eat something bad was a few chips on a ziplog bag I brought to share with my classmates.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he’s being selfish about hearing aids? I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a year. He uses hearing aids and can communicate orally. He always wanted me to learn ASL and I promised I would eventually. 

About three months ago, we decided to move in together and I started taking ASL lessons. He warned me that he usually doesn’t wear his HAs at home so communication might be harder, but promised to make adjustments until I get better at signing.

A month ago, we finally moved in together. Unfortunately things were harder than I imagined it would be.  When he said he doesn’t usually wear them at home, I assumed he would take them off before going to bed or so.  But he takes them off as soon as he’s back from work.

You can see where this is going. Because my ASL isn’t there yet I have to constantly write things down, and let me tell you it is not fun. It doesn’t feel like actual communication. He doesn’t like it either, he says I should always attempt to sign first, look it up if I have to, and writing down should be my last choice. This strict teacher attitude also drives me nuts.

Yesterday I was telling him something via signing then realized I couldn’t and didn’t feel like writing either so I told him to forget about it. He got upset at me for giving up and told me to at the least write it down. 

I was put off by his demanding attitude, I wrote, “maybe if you wore your fucking hearing aids, this wouldn’t be an issue.” He put them on and we started arguing. He said I knew what I was getting myself into, he warned me about it. 

I said yes but he didn’t tell me he throws them away as soon as he’s home. He said I’m exaggerating and asked me what I expected anyway. I told him I expected him to make some adjustments like he promised . He said he already does, “we write things all the time.” 

I told him that’s not an adjustment for me but for him . He said “sorry for being deaf my bad” I told him not to turn this into something it’s not. He can perfectly hear when he puts his HAs on. He chooses not to and makes this harder than it supposed to be. He can wear them at home a little more than he normally used to until I get better at signing. That’s such a simple solution, and he’s making this harder for both of us.

He asked me if I had ever thought they might be uncomfortable for him. I finally snapped and told him “and this is uncomfortable for me, he doesn’t have to be so selfish all the time”. 

He went, “I’m being selfish?” I told him yes, he’s being extremely selfish about this and I can’t believe how he doesn’t realize it. He said no, he can’t believe how I don’t realize I’m acting like a total bigot.

Now he’s ignoring me, so I am as well, and ~~I’m seriously considering packing my stuff and leaving.~~ eta: I was emotional when posting this, I'm not going anywhere

"AITA for throwing away my son’s coin collection because he refused to clean his room? This happened around 3 months ago. English is not my first language.

The house was looking rather messy, so I decided that my entire family would all do a big deep clean of the house. Everyone seemed to agree except for my 14 year old son. He said that he’d clean next week, but that he had to work on something now. I told him that he had to clean, because his room was really messy. There were clothes everywhere, his desk looked like a war zone, his bed wasn’t made, etc. But he still refused. I told him that if he didn’t clean his room I would throw away his coin collection. He told me that “threats don’t work on him” and that he had to work on something for school now.

Well, it wasn’t a threat, it was a promise. The next day I threw his entire collection in the trash can.

He came downstairs a few hours later to ask where it was, and he freaked the hell out when I told him that I had thrown it away.

He said that I owed him thousands of dollars worth of coins, that I was the worst dad ever, “how could I do this over some fucking cleaning?”.

But then everything went downhill in the past months. He’s refused to eat, he barely sleeps, he skips school and his grades have gone down. My wife says that what I did was completely out of line and that we owe him those few thousand dollars worth of coins. She also told me to mention that those coins were of sentimental value to him, because a large chunk of them were from his grandpa, who had inherited it from his dad, who had inherited it from his dad. 

I’m lost for what to do at this point. My wife is furious at me, my entire family thinks it was a large overstepping. I think it was justified to be honest.

"AITA for wanting my friend to be comfortable with me? #lgbtq+ 17F here. So in my class there is a girl who is a newcomer. Let's call her 'Gum'. We were very good friends and she is very open and free until one day....another friend casually dropped that I am bi and told Gum to stay ""cautious"" in a joking tone when I was just trying to show her how lightweight she is by picking her up. From that moment on,she \*constantly\* told me to stay 6 feet away(jokingly). I felt so bad as she was comfortable with me before, maybe we had not hugged before, but i felt a change in her demeanor. I clarified that i think of her as a good friend, not as a love interest. But the others around kept on teasing which i guess made Gum feel more uncomfortable to stay close with me. I thought she and the other guy who dropped i was bi, is homophobic and also jokingly called them the b word and told them to stop being homophobic(with explaination that her behaviour made me feel hurt and to just say that you are uncomfortable instead of always telling me to stay 6 feet away whenever i am in her vicinity). but she started crying saying i was accusing her and being mean. She also told me that she feels uncomfortable with anyone getting too close. I felt so bad again, this time for assuming that she is a homophobe when she can clearly have her boundaries. It was not my intention to make her feel uncomfortable.I am a physical affection kinda person but not in a romantic or sexual way. But fast forwarding some months later, she was clicking photos with another girl from our class ( I am not aware of them being close to each other..but who knows) who was picking her up like a bride for a photo. But she was unable to pick Gum up and I offered to pick Gum up for the photo. She quickly declined.  So aita for assuming her as a homophobe and expecting close friendship?

p.s:- I am not close to her anymore. I only talk to her when needed and she does the same in the class. She still chats with me friendly on whatsapp. but I really liked her as a friend back then as she was the one who made me feel comfortable in class and on whatsapp...  now it's reduced to whatsapp only

"AITA for asking my sister if I can have my bridal shower at her house?  I (29F) am getting married to my fiancé (29M) in a few months. We've spent a lot of money booking our venue, so naturally, we're trying to save as much as we can with the extra parties that come with the wedding. My sister (23F) and her girlfriend (25F) recently bought a beautiful home with a big backyard. 

My fiancé and I were over at my sister’s house, and I brought up the idea of having my bridal shower there. She made an ugly face and asked why I would want to do that. I explained that it would be cheaper and easier to get everyone together. My sister didn’t even try to hear me out before saying that she didn’t want “strangers” in her home. I asked who the strangers would be, and she said she doesn’t know my friends, she doesn’t know my fiancé’s family well, and she doesn’t want our family to know where she lives.

I tried to be understanding because I know my sister and our family don’t have the best relationship, but they’re not completely no-contact, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I told my sister that I feel like she’s trying to make my wedding all about her, and I wouldn’t do this to her if she ever gets married. My sister’s girlfriend then butted in and said she doesn't care that I’m getting married and our parents will never be welcomed into their home. 

That’s when I lost it, and I admit I may have taken it too far. I told my sister and her girlfriend that they are both being selfish by taking out their issues with our parents on me and my fiancé. My sister and I got into a heated argument, which led to her girlfriend telling us to leave. I tried calling my sister today, but she didn’t answer. I then tried calling her girlfriend, and she didn’t answer either. 

I feel like I could have taken things too far, but at the same time, I feel like my sister is overreacting to all of this. ",Asshole,1e8y3xx
"AITA for Making an Insensitive Comment About My Wife’s Dress? 
This situation has me conflicted. I’ve been torn apart between trusting in myself or my wife, and I just needed second opinions on the whole deal.

My wife and I, (I’ll call her Sasha) have been married for 2 years now. We’ve never had issues or arguments until now. Some necessary background — I come from a wealthier family, whose always had an “upperclass” mindset to everything, whereas Sasha’s had more of a financially difficult upbringing. Nevertheless, this has never seemed to be an issue until now. Every year, my father does a big thing for his birthday, which includes him renting out a yacht and inviting basically everyone he knows. Sasha and I hadn’t gone last year since we were out of town, but this will be her first year attending. 

When I was going over the gifts we would be bringing and what we would need to wear, Sasha said I didn’t need to bother picking her outfit, as she would be wearing a dress that’s “special” to her. This dress is honestly hideous, and couldn’t have cost her more than $20, but she’s insistent on wearing it since apparently, her father (who died 6 years ago) bought it for her, and she’s been waiting for the “perfect occasion” to wear it, and for some reason thinks my dads luxurious party is a good time. 

Now as I said before, my family is on the wealthier side. They already had been hesitant on me and Sasha’s marriage, as I was basically together with someone with no class or status whatsoever, so I already had to work extra hard to make sure it seemed she belonged on my side of the family. 

At first I asked her politely to wear a different dress, but when it seemed she wouldn’t budge, my irritation overtook me and I blew up at her, basically telling her that the dress was unacceptable in every situation possible, and that my family would never take her seriously in some goodwill-looking trash.
 I guess this struck a nerve, because she stormed off to her sisters house and hasn’t been back since. I have no idea what to do here. I’ve been thinking I might just go to the party alone and save myself the embarrassment and hassle, but I’m not too sure if I was harsh on Sasha. The party’s in a couple days, and she won’t answer my calls.

"AITA My 18 yr old kid sleeps all day and wont get motivated  AITA to ask my kid not to sleep all day and work full-time? My kid graduated in May, got a part-time job, and then attended a tech school. The course was a quick class that could have led to a full-time job after completion, provided they had completed the required job shadowing. My kid is a TikTok addict and stays up all night long and sleeps all day cannot for the life of them get a job that pays more and is full-time. The job they have pays $ 2.00 an hour, plus tips. They cannot even afford to pay the car payment in full, car insurance, gas for the car, and a cell phone bill, which costs around $600 a month total for all of that. But they continue to say to me, ""I'm 18"" and want to be able to stay out all night long, sleep all day, and do what they want. I told them that when they can afford to pay all the bills and help around the house, they can do as they please. However, this kid has never done any housework when asked. Their father was the same way, he was an addict who used his own mother for money, and his wife, and is a job hopper. I am also concerned that my kid is smoking weed, which addiction runs in both my family and their father's family, and their father is an addict and smoked weed around them and blew it in their face when they were a kid.

"AITA if I don't fetch my LDR boyfriend at the airport? I (24f) and my bf (30m) have been together for 3 years, 2.5years LDR and I no longer want to continue with this relationship...but I don't know how to get out of it.

 I was a student and so was he but he was studying abroad. He's a very negative person and required lots of reassurance because he was afraid I'd leave him for some other guy. I felt he needed some comfort and reassurance, so I decided to spend my savings to visit him(was a very long trip). But during that trip, I found out he subscribed to OF which I thought we had similar negative views on. We worked through it...

While he was schooling and working abroad, I am in the same country as his parents. I would help them whenever they are in need such as moving house, checking up on them every weekend. I thought they would spend the time to get to know me too, but that was never the case.

 I think what broke me is that, his mom told me it would benefit her son and partially myself if I were to change my legal name. I explained my values and my family background of how my name came about and how I didn't like my name at first (I was bullied for it) but I grew into it. She doesn't listen and said my name MIGHT bring misfortune to her son and possibly myself....My boyfriend is not in the country to help me. And he believes it's both parties (his family and I fault) because I don't talk back to them and continuously push my views.

On top of those, they like to compare me with others. His mum would say she's prettier than me when she was my age, she would say the neighbour girls are prettier and better. My boyfriend would say I should improve my language skills just like his older female cousin/female friends. 

There were so many occasions I wanted to leave, but he would talk me out of it saying we should work as a TEAM and I shouldn't give up on us. I feel I have been doing this all by myself....He's coming home today and I really don't want to fetch him...his parents will be there and they would drive him back home with them and I will be surrounded by them in their house. I am not comfortable, because I feel I will be cornered to stay. I don't want to go...I need suggestions...so AITA if I don't fetch him at the airport?

"AITA that I [21M] screamed at my fiancée [21F] when she called me in the middle of a competitive game EDIT:
Thank you y’all for your input. Among insults of me I found some genuine constructive criticism, and I will work on my anger issues, this was a wake up call. If anyone wondering, we talked and agreed that while this was the first time I acted like this towards her, I definitely have issues and she agreed next time heñp me restrain myself and find a good therapist, perhaps even the same one she goes to.

I’ll try to keep it short. But TLDR; at the bottom anyway. 

I have a bad habit of being overly aggressive when I’m losing in a game I’m invested into. My girl was working today as a guide at some outdoor activity out of town. She likes to call me whenever she’s bored , though checking with me if I am available for a call, so we could talk about something to distract her. I have no issue with this. However I really really dislike when someone disturbs me from my alone time. And I tend to snap at whoever distracted me. 

She called 2 times. First time I picked up while playing, told her that I’m sorry but I’m busy playing. She understood and hung up, while sounding a little hurt. I get that. But then she called a second time to ask will I pick her up from the drop off point after her work or she will just get a taxi. Unfortunately by that time I was losing bad and it so happened that I was violently cursing when I picked up the phone. She thought I was screaming at her and hung up crying. 

Now, I have two issues with this situation, she didn’t check with me this time if I am available and called directly which caught me off guard, second, I told her I was playing, but she called again, instead of texting me, and she knows I always respond. Now she’s mad at me and says it was a asshole move to scream at her for calling me. AITA?

"AITA for telling my friend his game is stupid? I'm 23f, he's 23m. He's my friend, has been since elementary school. He's gay, so there's nothing romantic between us either. Our friend group is very active, but he's not anymore. He's now disabled and unable to do most activities we used to do because he can't walk long distances and his dominant arm gives him problems. He was in an accident at his workplace.

He was very depressed for the longest time, and still struggles with things. It's been over a year since the accident. While he's not as depressed in general anymore, he does get sad when we go on our trips without him and he doesn't have good self image anymore. He's a VERY handsome guy, and any man would be lucky to have him. But he thinks because he's disabled and his income is disability that he's not fit to date anyone.

Anyone real...apparently.

Around the time he started feeling less depressed, his sister got him into video games which none of us in our friend group are into. We like being active, not pretending to be. But a few months ago, he got this one popular game and it really turned things around for him. Namely the fact you can date other characters, which is weird to me.

He's grown very attached to this game, and tries to talk to us about it. A couple in the group act interested, the rest of us just don't really care. I try to talk to him about getting out into the real world again but he doesn't seem interested.

Well once again he tried to talk about this game and this character he really likes, and I finally had enough. I told him no one cares about his stupid game and he needs to find someone real and experience the real world however he can again. No one else said anything and he left to get an Uber home. One of our friends tried to offer him a ride but he just quietly denied and left.

We all went home aftet and I got back to find he left our group chats and blocked me. I don't know if he's blocked the others as well. He left me one last message saying:

""That game is the only way I can feel like a normal person again. I'm not disabled. I can walk as long as I want. I can explore everything it will allow me without my body hurting. (Character) might not be real, but he looks at my character in ways I wish I could be looked at. I only get looked at with pity anymore. He doesn't see that, no one I meet in that game does. So forgive me for finding something that brings me joy. It can't replace real life. (Character) can't replace the love and touch of a real person. But it's as close as I'll ever get.""

Our friend group had mixed emotions about the whole thing. But when I ranted to my sister about it, she got indignant and told me that I messed up big. She said I was a jerk for making him feel more isolated and for not entertaining him talking about that dumb game. I told her I just wanted him to experience real life and real people instead of focusing on that stupid game but she hung up.

Few clarification: 
1) he  works in IT. It’s normal for mid level IT professionals to switch jobs. He is also underpaid in current job, salary hike should not be a problem. Although Finding a job in this market is really hard.

"AITA for continuing to sleep after a stranger requested I wake up? Had a 7 hour layover at the airport this afternoon. Thankfully the chairs here don’t have armrests, so I found an empty gate area and laid down, stretching about 4-5 chairs worth. Fell asleep. I’d been up for like 20 hours and I was exhausted. 

About an hour I awaken to some stranger tapping me. I say… can I help you? He said I need to move because he needs to sit there. There’s some kids sitting next to my feet, I ask him are you with them or??? Why do you need to sit *here* ? He ignored the kid question but then said “There’s a lot of people wanting to sit down here *gestured to the now-full gate area* and it’s ridiculous that you’re taking up so many seats. Move” I moved my feet toward me a little so 1 more seat was available. He said “No that’s not enough” 

I am still super confused as to why this guy felt the need to wake up a stranger and force them to move. I said no. I was here first, I am trying to rest, not sure why you’re waking me up. I tried to accommodate you by moving slightly but you rejected it” and put my eye mask back on and went back to sleep.

I (48M) recently lost my wife to cancer a year ago. It was very devastating for me and my daughter, Emily (17F). Three months ago, I remarried to an amazing woman, Jess (41F). We’ve been working together for several years and she helped me out a lot when my wife was in the hospital during treatments.Things have always been tense between me and my daughter, as she has always been a ‘mama’s girl’. They’ve been getting more tense since Jess and her son, Eli (8M) have moved in two months ago.To give background, me and my daughter live in a 2B2B house. When it was just us, my daughter and I each had our own rooms. Now that two more people have moved in, Jess and I thought it would be best if her son slept in my daughter’s room. Emily originally did not agree with this, but eventually came around when I told her it was either share a room or take the couch. I thought this arrangement was okay, because once she turns 18 I’m expecting her to move out on her own.Other than the room situation, Emily has been hostile with Jess and Eli since they’ve moved in. I cannot understand why she could have this resentment towards Jess, who has done nothing but try to be a motherly figure for Emily.Now, we are planning a family vacation for me, Emily, Jess, and Eli. Emily and I had made the vacation plans together right after her mother passed as a way for us to mourn together. I extended the invite to Jess and Eli after they moved in so we could all feel like a brand new family. I originally booked two rooms; one for me and one for Emily so we could have our own privacy in the evenings. But Eli has insisted on his own room, so he can feel like a grown up on his first ever vacation. I told Emily about the new arrangement, and told her I could cover the cost of a new room for her, but only half. I can only do half because I am taking Eli to Legoland like he was hoping for this vacation. I am hoping that Jess and Emily will be able to bond while I bond with Eli and our family will be blended by the time we are back home.I expected Emily to be okay with this, because she is a lot older than Eli and more mature than him.

(There's 6 of u It was several states away and 2 of my siblings drove since they lived closer, 3 flew, and I also flew but at the end of the day so I wasn't on the same flight as any of my other siblings.

My wife had asked me if she could come as she wanted to be included. I declined, saying this was a family only trip with me and my siblings. When I got there, all of my siblings had their spouses or significant other with them and everyone kept asking where my wife, Sara was. I told them I'd told her to stay home as I'd figured it would just be us and didn't expect partners to be invited. (Everything was planned via sibling group chat and while I didn't read everything, I don't recall seeing anything mentioned about partners being invited.)

Later, once things had settled down, I called Sara and told her all of the partners were here too and everyone missed her. I also apologized for not realizing partners were invited. She then asked if she could get a last minute ticket and come join us. While we can afford for her to, it's near the holidays and last minute flights now are expensive and we'd be on a very tight budget until the next time either of us gets paid, too tight for my comfort. So I ended up telling her no, it's not really in the budget and to enjoy having the house to herself for the week. 

Sara said I was being unfair and if I could take a week long vacation without her, she deserved to do the same. I told her this wasn't intentional, and her leaving for a week would be purely retaliatory and petty. Sara said if I wasn't going to let her fly out and join us, it was only fair she gets to take a vacation too, instead she's stuck at home where she's got to work, take care of my 3 dogs, (our 19yo neice would happily crash at out place and watch the dogs if we asked) take care of the house, and it's going to be raining all week so its very dreary there. I told Sara she's being ridiculous and I don't have time for this as I've got plans to go out. She called me a jerk and hung up. She's ignored my calls and texts since. AITA?",Asshole,18kzjzs
"AITA for telling a blind man to walk faster? I was late for class. The couple right in front of me was blocking my way and they were walking so slowy and I said “can you walk a little faster? I’m in hurry”  

I thought they were lovers walking slowly, but then they turned around and I noticed the man had a cane. The woman with him was helping / guiding him and was probably his aide / carer. I felt so embarrassed. I apologized immediately. The woman told me i needed to be more patient. 

I said I’m really sorry I didn’t notice he had a cane. The man laughed and said “I’m right here.” 

I said excuse me and walked between them. I heard them complaining about how kids (I’m actually 15, but I look younger) nowadays are assholes as I was leaving.

"AITAH for not going to best friend's wedding dinner after feeling betrayed from not being asked to be a bridesmaid? For context, me (24f) and my best friend (25f) have been friends since middle school, and even after high school, we still stayed in touch. We would hang out nearly every other week with her boyfriend, and it was genuinely one of the funnest times that I had, we even joked about me being a bridesmaid as I was like their “kid” or “little sister” at the time.

And then I got a boyfriend…my bf and my best friend did not like each other, they kind of bickered at each other when we would all hang out. After that, I wasn’t asked anymore to hang out. She would say that it’s because our schedules are pretty tight or I would ask if my boyfriend could join us (that wasn’t true), and I would tell her that if she would ask, I would make time just so we can hang out. She started hanging out with other people, and they’re genuinely so nice and fun to hang out with. There was a time I did ask her why we wouldn’t hang out again, and she said that the was mourning a friend of hers and the friends she’s been hanging out with were close to her because of the tragedy, and I completely understood, so I stopped asking. She said she would hang out with them or would only hang out with people that would basically force her to hang out with them, and she was feeling very depressed. I wanted her to have her space to grieve.

This was months ago. Ever since then, she would post about her hang outs with the other friends she made, and I would support her, why not, she’s my best friend. There was even a point where she said that she asked me multiple times to go to her graduation ceremony (she only asked me the day of by saying “hey are you busy today,”) and when I did see her message, I just saw that she was being proposed to during the ceremony. It hurt so much to not be there. For months, I felt like it was on me, I would go through our texts to see if maybe I did miss an invitation or something for her graduation…there was nothing other than the day of question.

This weekend, she is getting married, and I’m so happy for her. My boyfriend did not want to go ask they don’t like each other and believes that she doesn’t see me as a best friend anymore and I didn’t think much of it. I went to the ceremony today, and I found out that she had bridesmaids…and it hit me, she never asked me nor considered to ask me. When she was taking a picture with her bridesmaids, I just could not help but breakdown, it hurt so much. We did take pictures in the friend group picture, but I felt so hollow. I felt useless, I felt replaced. The big party is tonight and I just can’t make myself go, I already cried too much, but I’m scared of what she will say if I don’t go, I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend offered to go eat dinner with me tonight to help my brain get out of those thoughts, but I can’t shake the feeling of being so alone right now. Am I in the wrong for not going to the big wedding dinner? Am I the asshole?

Edit #1: some people are asking for more context, here you go. So before we started dating, I had a lot of free time (I was unemployed at the time) and I didn’t have any issues or any problems with my best friend. When I did start dating my boyfriend, her bf and mine kicked it off really well, they would send each other memes, he even helped my bf look into jobs at the time. My boyfriend did notice that the dudes that that friend group were very close to the point where they would send memes like “AYO let me hit?” And her bf joked along with it, but when she found out, she told me to control my boyfriend before she does it herself, and they were forced to stop texting. After that, the other guys would be joking like that to each other, but my boyfriend wasn’t allowed. After that, there was a point when I was talking to my best friend on how I wasn’t on meds and I need a better way to explain to my bf on how I am without my meds, and she said that if he doesn’t get it then I should end it with him. I thought she was joking and told her that it’s going to be fine, but looking back at it, I don’t think she was joking. (He completely understood the meds situstion and helped me through it luckily)

He never stopped me from hanging out with her or anyone, he actually was the one to suggest me to hang out with her and to support her. He was going to go to the wedding until I told him about how she was ignoring me and he did not like how she was treating me. And her wedding day landed on the day that one of high school classmates died years ago (they were a friend of mine).",No A-holes here,1oya7zo
"AITA for telling my plus sized friend to stop wearing skinny jeans? A few days ago, I (15F) was at the mall with my group of friends. One of my friends (16F) gets most of her clothes handed down from her sisters, or bought for her by her mom, so her fashion sense is like a millennial's: skinny jeans, striped shirts, leather jackets, skater skirts, peplum tops, ankle boots etc. She really wanted to improve her style, so we agreed to go shopping and help her pick something out. We helped her choose some cute, trendier tops, and moved on to the pants section.

She wanted to buy another pair of jeans, and I said she definitely had to ditch the skinny jeans and switch to baggy or straight leg jeans instead. She was really taken aback at this, and asked me why I thought she couldn't wear skinny jeans. I said that nobody our age really wears skinny jeans anymore, and she literally asked us to help her dress trendier. She said she didn't care if her clothes weren't flattering for her body type, which had nothing to do with my suggestion. She's a size 12, while the rest of us are 0-4, and she used to be very self conscious about her weight. She used to be bulimic last year but she's recovered now. She started asking me if I thought she wasn't skinny enough for skinny jeans and I told her it wasn’t that deep. I realised that she obviously preferred skinny jeans to baggy ones and I decided to drop the subject since it was her choice.

I thought we had moved past it but when we came back to school on Monday she was crying and said that I had triggered her into being self conscious again. I told her that all I did was give her fashion advice and it had nothing to do with her body type, yet she still blamed me. I said she was overreacting over a small comment and that it wasn’t my fault that she used to have mental issues. We got into a huge argument and now my friends won’t talk to me anymore and my classmates are all blowing up my phone asking me why I bodyshamed my friend. AITA?

Edit: I know that size 12 isn’t considered plus sized to some people the only reason I used that term is because my friend openly uses that phrase to describe herself.",Asshole,1b8c8ma
"AITA for telling my wife that she might be overreacting? My friend of more than 10 years and his wife live close by, and we get together often with them. My wife has known them for a shorter time, but we’ve spent a good amount of time together as couples. Lately, my wife and I have noticed that we don't share that much in common with them anymore, especially my wife, who hasn’t connected with them as much.

Recently, my friend mentioned they might be moving away, and ever since, my wife has been openly expressing (to me) how happy she is about this. She often says things like how she would love for them to move, and it makes her feel relieved. I told her that I don't like hearing her talk about being happy that they might move away. It just doesn't ""feel right"". She said ""okay"" and dropped it at that moment.

However, since then, she’s continued to talk about how spending time with them isn’t enjoyable for her, and how she feels forced to do things she doesn’t like when we hang out. I tried telling her that while I understand that it's not always fun to hang out with them and we should set boundaries and limit our contact with them, maybe she's overreacting and could be seeing things too negatively and seeing the glass half empty. I pointed out that they’re a big reason we aren't lonely sometimes. This led to an argument, with her saying I was invalidating her feelings.

"AITA I yelled at a cop for standing in a four way intersection and not directing traffic 🚦 Context, it was a four way intersection with traffic lights and there was a car being loaded onto a flatbed at one of the corners. Cars were pulling up and stopping in all lanes regardless if the traffic lights were green. The Police officer was in his high visibility green vest standing in the middle of the intersection and was visibly irritated, cars were stopping and he would sort of point left or right. When I say sort of he barely raised his arm above his waist. Also there were two officers in a squad car parked in a turning lane just talking from what I could tell.  

As I pulled up I wasn't sure if I should follow the traffic signals or wait for the officer as he just turned and faced the flatbed truck. Our lane and the opposing lane were just stopped there when the light turned green, eventually right before the like turned yellow someone in the opposite lane just went. 

At this point I was very upset, after waving at the cop he turned towards me and points in both directions (left and right) and made a face like (what, what do you want).

 I rolled down my window and yelled ""can I go?! What are you doing?!""

His response was ""is the light green?"" (It wasn't)

Then I said ""we don't know what's going on you should be the one directing traffic, do your F****** job"" 

He mumbled something and turned back towards the truck. 

At this point we understand when the light turns green we could turn. And so we did and went about our day. 

I mean, in hindsight I should have realized he was giving people simple  directions to turn because they couldnt go straight down that one particular lane, but when he stands there waving his arms you immediately assume he's controlling traffic but when he's barely raising his arms above his waste and turns his attention to the flatbed like he wasn't just waving at cars really had me confused in the moment.

"AITA Telling my mum off for buying my 2 year old McDonald’s on the way home without asking My mother picked my daughter up from daycare yesterday and I had spoken to her earlier in the day to confirm she was still good to pick her up. 

I had mentioned if she wanted to stay for dinner or not on the phone as well. 

She arrived to my place and my daughter had McDonald’s in her lap. I didn’t say anything at the time but my partner and I were both annoyed and frustrated. So I wanted to the next day and called her and said “hey next time please call and ask about buying my daughter take away before you do it?” That’s pretty much it. 

Well she then blows up saying how I did not take her feelings into consideration when saying that to her and how I called her to tell her rather than waiting until next time and subtly mentioning it. ? She proceeded to then tell me how if I couldn’t see how I was being unfair and ‘mean’ that I should think about it. Going on about how she can’t be a natural grandmother etc.  

This all considering 2 weeks ago she picked her up the first time and called to ask if she could get her McDonalds on the way home as she herself was hungry and didn’t want to get it in front of her and not get her anything? 

I am very much a people pleaser and struggle with confrontation and doing this was already hard enough but I could not have expected that reaction. Which then makes me question it all.

Edit: just to clarify, I didn’t yell or have a go at her. Verbatim I said “please next time if you can call before buying her takeaway at dinner time” to which she then proceeded to lecture me on how I don’t let her be a grandma. In addition she picks up my daughter from daycare once a week because she wanted to be involved not because we need help and we wanted her to be a part of that part of her life too

"WIBTA if I (28ftm) refuse to be part of my sister's (35F) wedding? My sister is getting married this year and wants me to be the maid of honor or at least one of the bridesmaids, and has pretty much already decided that it will happen. I feel terrible about this for many reasons. 

One, no one in my family knows that I am transsexual, they just think I look and sound like a freak. I hate being lumped in with women like I want to be one. My sister is aware that I have always hated wearing dresses and ""girly clothes"" and doing things like wearing makeup or styling my hair, but keeps insisting we will go shopping together for a dress and high heels and she'll find someone to do my makeup and hair for me. No, I would not be allowed to wear pants/a suit and not wear makeup.

Two, I hate having any amount of attention on me at all. My family is the kind that insists on making toasts every 15 minutes or so at family dinners and I have never made a toast or speech at any of these because it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I cannot present in front of people looking at me and I cannot make speeches of any kind.

Three, I am not that close with my sister. We used to be close when we were younger and both trapped in our parents' house, but nowadays we very rarely talk (maybe a text every 3 weeks or so). I understand that out of all the family we have, I am the closest family member for her, but it still doesn't feel right to be pretending that I actually know her enough to be part of her wedding when I really don't. She doesn't talk to anyone else in the family besides our mom sometimes and she doesn't have many friends.

I really don't want to hurt her feelings and am fine with coming to the wedding and sitting in the corner if she allows me to just wear pants and a dress shirt, but insisting I be part of the wedding in such a way is something that I know I won't be able to do in a way she likes and I won't hate myself for.

"AITA Want to Watch Football Live and Not Record The Gameh Throwaway

My (32M) Wife (27F) had her in-laws in town for thanksgiving this past weekend.  We hosted and we spent the entire day together. We get along fine.

But this conflicted with the game.  I told them I wanted to watch the game and would be staying home.  My mother in-law said I could just record it and watch it later.  I gently declined and said this was an important game and there was zero chance I'd be missing this live.

So my wife and I have 3 teenage kids, and we try not to fight in front of them.

The other day, we were all down in the kitchen having a nice time, laughing and goofing off with one another. We noted that all of the kids had appointments the next day, and we have 3 drivers, 2 cars, and 5 people with schedules. So we all started trying to figure out who would move who were, and so on. My wife started walking away and said to me, ""come upstairs."" I said ""No, why?"" because I was having a great time bantering with my kids and figuring it out. \[IN RETROSPECT, I SHOULD HAVE JUST AGREED TO THIS.\]

So she stayed, and then 2 minutes later she got in a verbal fight with my elder daughter because my daughter was contributing to the conversation but my wife wanted the ""adults to figure it out."" That wasn't fun bickering, it was just a mean fight between the daughter and her.

So after that fight was over, my wife came over and whispered to me, ""See that's why I wanted to go upstairs."" I was really frustrated at this because it seemed like an ""I told you so"", and because she was initiating that conversation in the middle of the kitchen with all the kids around. I wanted to respond, but not in the middle of the kitchen, and at that point both of us were engaged in kitchen work and wasn't trying to leave any longer.  S

So I just said, ""What?"" She glared at me, and continued to either mouth words silently to me or whisper to me, and I said ""what"" or ""I can't hear you"" because I felt like she was trying to say ""I told you so / this is your fault"" without my being able to respond.

"AITA for upsetting my SIL by having a different opinion? So I 31f am married to my husband 34m and have been for the last 2 years. He has a twin, let’s call her Amy who has a daughter, Chloe 17f. Evidently, she had Chloe when she was young. Where they come from, this is not unusual.

I am going to be honest, I hate kids, they are annoying and frankly, they can’t do anything helpful. My husband knows this and is okay with this, he loves kids but says he has no desire to have them. 

I have never gotten along with my SIL, probably never will. I frankly could never do what she did, throw my whole life away at that age just to become someone’s caretaker for the rest of my life. I come from a long line of women who don’t have kids until they are in their 30s and my mom always told me it was skanky to make a kid at a young age when you probably can’t even take care of yourself. Even if Amy is quite successful, I still think it was selfish to keep a child when you are a child yourself and when she did not even know if she could give Chloe the life someone should have.

When we were at my SIL’s house yesterday she jokingly said “so is there a kid on the way or should I stop asking?”. I got irritated because she knows I don’t like kids, I answered “stop asking, not everyone is as selfish as you are and just care about themselves and what they think is best” she looked taken aback and asked what that was supposed to mean.

She called me and we talked about the money stuff and I told her what my money situation is with cut hours at work and it being the slow season for my husband’s job. She  told me that 6 months is plenty enough time to save up money to go all the way out there since we would have to take time off work and he doesn’t get vacation pay since he works for a family owned business and my job doesn’t offer vacation pay.

My sister's husband keeps buying my daughter toys and clothes that one associates with boys, and some of them are not cheap either. My daughter is two and she does take after her father and in boy clothing she often gets mistaken as a boy. My daughter does enjoy the toys, and I can see past it since I know he loves his niece. Her father does not, and I am sick of hearing his mouth and tbh I also do get annoyed seeing him treat her like a boy. 

I would much rather he stop gifting her things, but he just cannot say no to her. I get it that I have a dated view but it is frustrating having people mistake her for a boy. I have tried to have a conversation with him, but he is argumentative by nature what do you expect from an autistic attorney? I hate the fact he comes at me with a logical response to my emotional plea. He is disrespecting my wishes as a parent. 

So I told him if he cannot stop buying her stuff then he cannot see her. My sister is upset with me because he told her. I just explained I do not want my daughter to be viewed as a boy she is already seen as one. My sister told me to get over my issues and stop projecting shit on my daughter. So I told her if she cannot respect my issues then she is also free to never see her again either.

She’s one of them kids who does dancing and acts in all the school plays and who the whole family adores. I have never really taken a liking to Mary just because of how loud she is. When I first had my son and my sister and Mary came to see him for the first time, she was asking me about maternity and things that wasn’t really any of her business. When I reprimanded her and told her it wasn’t her business, my sister went into a strop with me basically saying she’s just “young and curious”. My sister didn’t speak to me for 2 weeks because she didn’t agree with me telling her child that but eventually Mary did apologise “off her own back” or so my sister said.

Mary has really taken it too far over the past month as my husband decided to build a two person swing and a slide set for my kids when they get a bit older. I guess since it’s just sitting there Mary thinks she’s got every right to use it which I’ve never said she could at all. Last night at about 4 30 I looked out my window and saw Mary swinging on the swings. I was furious since it’s my garden and she didn’t even ask me! I went out and basically said to her in a raised tone “This isn’t your garden and these swings aren’t yours you need to leave now”. Mary ran off crying and looking shocked which I did feel bad about. Within an hour I had missed calls from my mum and dad, my two sisters and my brother and countless messages basically saying what I did was wrong and tasteless and is upsetting to a little girl. When my husband returned from work I told him about the incident and he started freaking out at me saying he told Mary she could use the swings and now he’s messaged my sister and her husband to apologise for my behaviour but I don’t think I’m in the wrong?? It is my garden? So Am I the ahole?",Asshole,1fgp8zt
"AITA for killing a cockroach with hairspray and a lighter? I (25M) live with my fiancee (23F). We moved into an apartment and sometimes get cockroaches. I hate them so I took my fiancee's hairspray and a lighter and used it to make a makeshift blowtorch to kill a cockroach.

One time, her brother (18M) came over and I killed a cockroach that way for a laugh. As usual my fiancee laughed about it but later I found out he thought it was ""over the top"" and seemed like I took ""pleasure in killing an insect"". And that I should have just ""grabbed it with toilet paper and flushed it down the toilet"".

"AITA for insisting my daughter pronounce her name like I intend to I (35f) live with my husband and daughter Saoirse (9, fake name), and my stepson (16) lives alternate week with us. 

I named my daughter Saoirse because it was  my great grandfather’s sister’s name. They actually came from the country of the name’s origin. I thought the name was lovely so used it to name my daughter but I pronounce it the English way. So, I call my daughter SAO-ER-SE, like what you would expect if you see the spelling. It’s still lovely and my daughter is proud of how there’s no other Saoirse in her friend group.

A few weeks ago my stepson’s aunt picked him up to take him to his mom’s. My stepson introduced Saoirse to his aunt and she said “Oh, what a beautiful name! Let me guess, it’s spelled Saoirse? You know, the (people of my great grandfather’s origin) will pronounce it SER-CHAY.”

The aunt actually speaks the language. My daughter was all excited to learn why her name could be pronounced so differently and the aunt gave her a quick 10 minute course on pronunciation. My daughter loved this new name so much she insisted on pronouncing it as the aunt showed her. She introduced herself to everyone new as SER-CHAY from then on.

This hurts me as I put a lot of thought and love into choosing the name and the English pronunciation I gave my daughter makes the name extra special for us. I asked my daughter to please pronounce her name the way she used to as it was the name I chose for her. She said it’s the “right way” to say her name and I was the one saying her name wrong all these years. 

I told her the next time she introduced herself as SER-CHAY I’m going to correct her on the spot. My daughter is now sulking. AITA?",Asshole,18znxkc
"AITA for sniffing my girlfriend's breath after she played the tuba? So I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year now. She’s incredibly talented and recently joined a local community brass band and plays the sousaphone (the giant marching tuba that wraps around your body...).

Now, I don’t play any instruments myself, so I’ve been learning a lot just from being around her. One of the things I didn’t realize is how physically demanding playing the tuba is. Lots of air, lots of breath control, etc. She usually comes home from rehearsals pretty wiped.

The other night, she got back from band practice and plopped down on the couch. We were just chilling, talking about our days, and I was genuinely curious—like, weirdly curious—about what her breath would smell like after an hour of blowing into a giant brass instrument. Not in a gross way, just like... is it metallic? Brassy? Saliva-y?

So I leaned over, kind of jokingly, and said, “Hey, what does tuba breath smell like?” and got close to her mouth to sniff. She backed away, looking super confused and said, “Did you just *smell* me?” I explained I was just curious, and she kind of laughed it off at first, but then got weirdly quiet.

Later she told me it was “invasive and weird,” and that she didn’t like me treating her like some kind of “science experiment.” I apologized, but she still seems upset and said it made her feel self-conscious.

I genuinely didn’t mean anything by it. It wasn’t a kink thing, it wasn’t a judgmental thing—I just had a random question pop into my head and acted on it. She says it was disrespectful.

So AITA? I realize I may have gone too far by randomly doing it but yeah...

**EDIT:** For the record, no, it didn’t really smell like anything. Just normal breath. Maybe a little warm? Definitely no brass.",No A-holes here,1l1vjo6
"AITA for telling my mom she'll hold us back on vacation? For context my mom deals with pretty bad spasms and leg pain(not sure what the exact causes are, could be arthritis) and because of that she isnt active at all, and will only go to play badminton 1x/week some weeks. I have encouraged/motivated her and tried to help her in any way to get more active even as much as just walking for 10 mins on the treadmill. We are set to go to Vancouver which is known for hiking and scenery, and when planning the trip, i just pointed out to the fam that it'll be difficult to do a lot of the outdoor things since our mom has to take a break every 10-15min from a simple walk.

She got mad and said that we should just go one without her (typical mom exaggeration). This isnt the first time that we've had to stop everything we were doing on a vacay just for her to rest after a literal 5 min walk. I know it sounds very harsh on me for saying but my POV is telling the truth and wanting her to be better and be more fit so she can enjoy these things as a family. I'm just not sure she fully does everything to try and get better. After the initial discussion she said she can watch from afar and isn't bothered by us hiking or doing active stuff so i thought everything was good.

then later she and my dad started arguing and she started crying talking about ""i don't want to go to Vancouver now because my kids think i hold them back"". I feel bad for what I said initially but I still hold on to the fact that she simply just does not do enough to want to get better and that yes there are things that are out of your control(periods, hormonal issues, age, etc) but there are some things like again taking a 5min walk to at least improve the tinniest, but she doesn't do that.

"WIBTA for inserting myself and older kids in a trip my husband planned for himself and our youngest? My husband is from a small village in Eastern Europe. We have 3 kids, 7yo twins, and a 3yo. Our 3yo has never been abroad to meet extended family.

I have visited as a newlywed, with the twins at 6mo, and again when the twins were 1.5. The twins have been a third time at 4yo when my husband took them on his own (I was too pregnant).

My husband said that the most recent trip as a solo parent was miserable. His family doesn’t speak English, the twins don’t speak their dad’s native language. The twins were old enough to recognize this and they didn’t respond well. They didn’t want to try any food that was “different.” They didn’t want to interact with or be alone with my in-laws, which I’m sure broke their heart. They were homesick for me, and there was probably some culture shock. They finally started warming up in the final days of the 2 week trip, but by then he was so exhausted of being primary caretaker and source of entertainment that he regretted the trip.

My youngest was born later that year and my MIL came to live with us for 6mo to be his primary caretaker when I went back to work. She returned the next year and stayed for 2mo. During her time here we get along fine, but only communicate the bare min via google translate. I know that she loves me, but I don’t feel a strong bond. The same may be true for our twins, they’re shy to put effort into interacting and it almost seemed rude at times. I did try to facilitate but she seemed to want to avoid awkwardness and poured her attention into the baby.

Another element is that she is a hardworking badass and the kids and I have lived a comfortable, “first world” life. When we visit them abroad, it is a TON of effort for my in-laws. My MIL cooks everything from scratch- they don’t have a ton of convenient/easy options. She will not accept help in any form when I am there, but when she is here, she does everything.

My husband wants to take the youngest to visit his family. I was originally OK with it, considering the expense, but now that it is becoming a reality I want to explore the twins and I joining. He isn’t in favor. He has mentioned how hard it is to “keep us entertained.” It is also triple the cost, which is a lot of financial pressure for us. He says if he goes with the youngest, they would stay the full 2 weeks in his village, but if the twins and I join, he would only want to stay there ~4 day, and instead explore some other Euro locations as a family.

I want to foster a good relationship between the twins and their grandparents, and I don’t think that excluding them from this trip “bc it will be easier” helps that.  I don’t want to burden his family or reduce the amount of QT he is able to spend there by inserting ourselves. That said, I am not convinced the 3yo is going to behave any better than the twins did when they were 4, and I think my being there might actually be helpful. Would I be the asshole for insisting that we turn this into a full family trip?",Asshole,1lhgrc2
"AITA For telling my husband he can't go to a football game on Thanksgiving My husband (38M) and I (36F) have been married for 11 years and have 3 kids (10, 7, &amp; 3).  My husband was a SAHD for our first 2 kids as my job paid much more than his at the time.  Now that the older 2 are in school, he is back to work and our youngest is in daycare.  He's been at his job for about 2 years now.  

The company he works for has season tickets to pretty much all of our local professional sports teams.  Most of the time the use these for the execs to take clients but sometimes they will raffle them off to anyone who wants to put their name in.  My husband always puts his name in but hasn't ever been picked.

That was until his company raffled off tickets for the local NFL team's Thanksgiving game.  Without even talking to me about it first, he decided to put his name in and wouldn't you know it, he was picked.  He texted me immediately all excited about getting 2 tickets to the game. At first I was happy for him, but then he said it was for the Thanksgiving game and I started to have questions.

We are hosting my family for Thanksgiving this year. My husband has known about this because it was decided at least 2 months ago. I have a big family and we are expecting around 20 people. He knows that I am going to need his help that day.  The game is right in the middle of the day too so he would be gone the entire day.

I reminded him about all of this and at first he said we should cancel on hosting and go to the game together. I told him that's not happening. He then said that my family can help with stuff and that ""I'm sure you would be fine without me as you do all the cooking anyway."" 

I asked him if he really thought that ditching his family on Thanksgiving was an OK thing for a father and husband to do and he said that this is the first time he has won something like this and he doesn't know if he'll ever have a chance to get seats this good because the cost is way out of our price range.  

I asked if he could swap the tickets for a different game and he said it doesn't work that way.  Either he accepts the tickets or he declines and the company gives them to another employee. I told him the reason they probably raffled the Thanksgiving game off is because everyone else at his company knows that day is about family first and no one is dumb enough to ditch out on their family like that.

I told him he needs to decline the tickets but that if he wins a raffle for some other game then he can definitely go no questions asked. He told me I was being unreasonable and that there's got to be a way for him to help get things ready and still go to the game.  I told him if he goes to the game he might as well get a hotel too because I don't want him coming home that night.  

He has until this coming Friday to accept or decline the tickets and he's still pestering me about it and trying to tell me all the things he would help with before he goes. But I know half of that stuff wouldn't happen. ",Asshole,1ooh4yc
"AITA For Making My Daughter (11F) and Her Friends Leave An Olivia Rodrigo Concert Early? Hi Everyone I (M32) took my daughter (11F) and 2 of her friends to the opening day of Olivia Rodrigo's Guts Concert. 

I made the mistake of assuming that Olivia Rodrigo was a child's singer since she grew up as a Disney star (Daughter loved her in high school musical) and her album SOUR being relatively child friendly. 

I'm a single dad after my daughter lost her mom due to health issues a few years ago, so I try my best to make her feel special. This includes taking her and her friends to see their favorite singers such as Taylor Swift (We loved that tour and nothing will be beat that). 

I assumed that the Olivia Rodrigo tour would be similar to the Taylor Tour, however it was very sexual with Olivia wearing very revealing outfits and gestures such as grabbing her chest multiple times throughout the tour, humping the air, and alot of the lyrics that are sexual in nature. 

I understand it is my fault for not paying attention to her newer album and monitoring what my daughter was listening to, but because of her history, I had assumed that she was safe. 

I have no fault with the singer, she's aloud to break out of the child star era, but the audience was filled with a majority of younger kids who were fans of her work, it seems like an odd shift of her personality. 

Anyways, I took my daughter and her friends to the concert, I paid for everything. However about half-way through the tour, I decided it was best for us to leave because this was not a place for kids. I felt terrible exposing my daughter and her friends to a softcore strip club basically. 

I thought I made a good decision, however my daughter is upset because her friends and their parents think I was over reacting, and that's how performers perform. I don't go to alot of concerts, only have the younger days of blink 182 concerts, and Taylor swift to compare.  Taylor Swift seemed very child friendly but this tour was not.

"AITA for not being a helicopter parent? Thank you for your comments. This experiwnce has taught that I'll never ask americans a question. I'm very sorry your country is apparently such a terrible place that you can't leave rhe house without being kidnapped but not the whole world is that way.

No, I can't just change my job but what did I expect from people who probably still live with their parents. I had to leave school at 16 and it's not that easy to find a job that pays enough for my daughter's hobbies and our house. I work 6 hours a day and the rest of the time I mostly spend with my daughter.

Why do so many of you think they know what my relationship with my daughter is like? You're less than strangers. I love my daughter and she knows that. When I'm not working, we spend almost all thw time together. I know what's going on in her life because she tells me and she knows that she can come to me for everything. 

I'm starting to think that some of you have never interacted with a 12 year old before. They are actually capable of thinking for themselves and making decisions. My daughter wanta to go to ballet. She knows I can't pick her up because of my work hours so she can decide to take the train or not go. 

You seem to think that just because I give my daughter her freedom and don't treat her like a helpless creature who has to be protected and watched 24/7 means I don't interact with her at all. Once you grow up you'll understand that there isn't just the 2 extremes in life

"AITA for smoking weed in my living room on the day that my two younger cousins visited? So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.

My mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.

Well as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being ""irresponsible."" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. 

I know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.

"AITA for bringing in-law to my cousin's house? I decided to visit my cousin when I went to his city. We are a bit further apart but I manage to come few times in a year. This time I decided to bring my in-law (Ted) with me.



Now, my cousin (Mark) has a bit of a history with Ted. Mark was apparently bullied by Ted and called very hurtful words etc. But that was many years ago. Around 6, to be precise. So it shouldn't have been a huge deal. Mark told me a few days ago not to bring Ted to his house, but I thought that was just him sticking to his hostility and that he would quickly soften up when I bring Ted and have a nice talk..



Oh, how wrong I was.... When I came Mark wasn't there, just his mother who welcomed me and gave me a worried look. I reassured her that everything will be fine. 

Anyways, when Mark came I had to get Ted out of there, before the things could escalate



His mother approached me and told me that I was out of line. I wanted to tell her they had problems years ago and that there was no need to be hostile now, but she told me that he still has extreme anxiety when he  sees the guy. She even showed me medical documents that show that he had significant issues from the incident from back them, feeling heaviness in chest and agitation and anxiety for days after reminding himself  of bullying. She told me that one time he even had a ""freeze stress response"" when they were close by

"WIBTA if I asked my SIL to spend a bit more time in the kitchen? Hello! I just want to mention my cultural background, so maybe that will adjust some of your judgement (because I hear how bad the title sounds). Basically, my husband is one of three brothers and they all got married around the same time. All us ladies had kids at around the same time, and my SIL (Call he Dee) was a SAHM like me and other SIL until her youngest kids turned 2. She has a wonderful career that she loves, so returned to it. She doesn't really need to work as all our families are very fortunate in the finance department. But it does mean she has less time to do the sort of domestic things we do, so I wanted to mention it because maybe she's just used to doing quick meals all the time. 

Anyway, for one of our holidays we rented a big property. It had a huge rumpus room for the kids and was on a five acre property. It was only for three days, so between us the couples came up with a schedule where we each picked a day to cook so the others can take a break. Additionally, all the couples had a day with all the kids (at least nine under 11). 

On Dees day, she woke up and spent time with all the kids with her husband. They made pancakes with the kids, and then all the other meals for the rest of the day she just made stuff she had pre-prepared earlier, like marinated roast chicken (just stuck in the oven), or bbq chops (she had premade all the sides). Dessert was ice cream and trifle (basically very easy stuff). In comparison I and other SIL had put on desi full feasts so everyone had a really nice day. Ofc that also meant a massive kitchen cleanup. We didn't mind at all, but we're a bit disappointed that one of our days wasn't reciprocated in the kitchen by Dee. 

Is this a petty thing to bring up? I haven't been in the workforce since I got married, so maybe I'm overthinking this. Thanks",Asshole,17cy31v
"AITA for saying that my girlfriend's music isn't that special Please let me preface this by saying that I love my girlfriend and I love the fact that she is very passionate about her music. I think it's cute that she still plays in the band she formed in highschool. They aren't bad and neither are the songs she writes but that's not enough to live off. 

They play in pubs or the occasional town festival but all of them need to work a real job to pay bills. I'm not trying to devalue that. I'm currently at uni on scholarship but I still need to work a part time job to afford rent. My girlfriend is a very kind and warm person but she can also still be a bit naive about how the world works.

We met up with a few friends tonight and at some point the topic of our plans for the future came up. My girlfriend said something along the lines of ""Maybe we're lucky and our music gets discovered so I won't have to choose an adult career"" She said it in a joking way and all our friends laughed except for me. 

She looked at me weirdly and asked why I was looking like that. I told her I just didn't think she should get her hopes up like that because her music was good but not special enough for her to turn it into a career.

That kind of killed the mood and even though someone changed the topic quickly, my girlfriend stayed cold towards me. I decided to leave about 30 minutes later because it was getting late and I have uni tomorrow morning. When I told my girlfriend that we had to go she said that I should go without her and that she'll be staying with a friend tonight.

When I got home I texted her asking her to please let me know when they left and when they get to her friend's place because I wanted to know that she made it there safe. She left me on read and even though it's past the time she usually stays out she still hasn't texted me.

"AITA for telling my sister her opinion didn't matter when she said she didn't want a cat in the house? Me (28F) and my sister (25F) live with our parents. I've always wanted a cat but parents were always really against it. The biggest excuse they gave me was that I wasn't financially capable of taking care of a pet and honestly, fair enough.

I'm a lawyer and for the last 1.5 years, my practice grew enough that I can comfortable support myself and take care of a pet. So a year ago I broght up the topic again.

I told my sister first because she was always supportive and I wanted to get that easy yes first. She, like before, has said that she is fine with it as long as she doesn't have to take care of it but she said she doesn't think me having money will be enough to convince our parents.

I brought it up to dad next and while dismissive at first, he said he doesn't want to get in the way of my dream so if I can convince mom, he'd also be fine with it. This was huge for me because I always considered dad as the biggest hurdle. So I proceeded to use every trick in the book to convice mom. It took a while but she finally said yes. Well, she said ""do whatever you want"". But it wasn't a no, so...

I was super excited, I ran to my sister and said our parents were on board. She was shocked. Not happy shocked, like I told her someone died shocked. She was silent for a while and eventually said ""Well I don't want a cat in the house"".

I didn't take it seriously at first, I really thought she was kidding. But she was serious. I asked her why and she said she didn't want to clean litter or puke. I told her I don't expect her to do any of that, I've told her this multiple times before so it didn't really make sense to bring it up now.

After I pressed her further, she told me she's said yes all those years because she was sure our parents would never say yes. So basically, she let our parents be the bad guys while she looked supportive. But when our parents said yes, she realised there will actually be a cat in the house and she was absolutely not okay with it and she will never be okay with it.

I was pissed to say the least, I told her, I'm getting the cat anyway and she started crying and said she lives in this house too so she should also have a say. I said normally that would be a fair argument and if she was honest from the beginning, I would try to find a compromise but since she lied about this for so long, her opinion no longer mattered.

I ended up getting a cat from our local shelter. Mom and I fell in love with her from the first day and I can honestly say my sister loves her too but she literally tells everyone who will listen that she was against it but I just said her opinion didn't matter. Recently she brought it up with some mutual friends and even when I gave the full context, the majority have said that while she shouldn't have lied, I was TA for ignoring her feelings. This really bothered me as I don't think I was in the wrong for my reaction but now I'm not so sure.

"AITA for asking to be invited in my niece’s birthday? I did 10 years in prison for theft. While my family occasionally saw me, I thought it was because I was sent to a prison hours away from them. 

I didn’t realize when I got out how much has changed. I stayed with my mom and have tried to get back on my feet but most people will not hire a felon. I’ve had shitty jobs. 

My brother and his wife Amy I never met until I got out have been cold to me. They have children that I would like to be around and I have only seen them twice in the years I have been out. 

One of my nieces is having a birthday party and I’m not invited because Amy’s parents are hosting because they don’t want a “druggie thief” in their home.  I overheard my brother telling my mom this on speaker phone. 

I took the phone away and yelled at my brother that I have changed and I would like to be included in my niece’s party and my brother said a “leopard doesn’t change his spots” and he doesn’t want me around his wife and kids. My mother should have told me that. 

My mom took the phone back and apologized to my brother saying she will be there and bring a cake. I tried talking to my mother about it and my mom said “it is what it is and she’s not missing out of the birthday because of me”

"AITA for expecting my boyfriend to put gas back in my car after borrowing it? I’m F (20) and my boyfriend is M (33). We live separately, but I stayed at his place for a week recently. I’m a student with almost no income, while he works full-time in the food and beverage industry.

At the start of the week, I took on some freelance delivery jobs. I filled up my tank with about **$15 worth of fuel**, worked the whole day, and later topped up another **$8** because my tank was already low.

After that day, I didn’t work again for the rest of the week. Instead, I let my boyfriend use my car every day to commute to work. Sometimes he used it to bring me food, which I appreciated.

But when I got my car back on Saturday, the fuel gauge was down to **two bars**. I was upset because **I** had paid to fill the tank, **he** used the car the entire week, and when I finally needed it again, there was almost nothing left. I had to drive somewhere about 40–45 minutes away, so I immediately had to think about refueling again. I only get about **$30 a week**, and I also have debts; fuel is a big chunk of my weekly budget.

To me, it felt like basic respect that if you borrow someone’s car all week, you return it with at least some fuel in it. Even topping up a small amount would’ve helped.

When I told him how I felt, he got defensive. He said he’s done a lot for me and that if he “calculated everything I’ve used,” I wouldn’t be able to repay him. He also said he thought *I* would refill it.

The thing is, I know he’s helped me in many ways, but I’m also a broke student. I’ve never asked him for luxuries nor jewelleries, or fancy dates. We usually eat at home. And when we do go out, sometimes he asks me to order our food together or pay for my own food. I was usually okay paying for my own food, but I wished he could have princessed me a bit and offer to pay at least, and I feel pressured to pay so I don’t seem ungrateful. It’s mentally and financially exhausting.

There were even weeks before this one where I filled up the tank but didn’t get to use my own car because he borrowed it the whole time. Now he’s saying he should start “charging me for everything I use,” which really hurt because he knows I can’t afford to split everything 50/50.

All I wanted was something small: if he used my car the entire week, don’t return it nearly empty.

It makes me sad because part of me feels like… shouldn’t a grown man with a steady job be a bit more thoughtful? Shouldn’t he consider my situation? I don’t have the luxury of casually spending extra money on fuel every time someone else drains it.

I already feel guilty for being poor. I don’t want to feel guilty for asking for basic courtesy. I didn’t ask for much just don’t leave my tank on two bars after using my car all week.",Not the A-hole,1p9ud6r
"AITA for telling my brother's friend that if everybody seems to hate him, he's the common denominator? Kind of a low stakes post, but here goes. I live in Massachusetts, and my brother has a new friend from Texas named Fernando. Fernando was visiting us on Sunday, when he said he was basically chased out of Texas. I asked him what he meant, and he claimed he didn't feel safe in Texas anymore. I asked him to elaborate, and basically, he said that nobody in his town liked him including his own family. I said, ""Something I learned from Reddit is that if one person dislikes you, that's one thing. But if absolutely nobody likes you, you're the common denominator."" He said that was an extremely out of touch and privileged thing to say. My brother said I ""clearly"" have never been bullied or discriminated against. I told them that it's ridiculous to think an entire town would randomly gang up on a grown man for no reason - it's not the 1950s anymore. Fernando went, ""You don't know shit about me so don't fucking assume my life."" I told him I wasn't going to sit there and be sworn at for no reason, and I went upstairs. I overheard Fernando saying I ""showed my ass"" and my brother saying, ""He doesn't know what it's like for us."" And basically reassuring Fernando that he's safe and protected here.

AITA? I kind of figure that if the common denominator thing was bad advice, it wouldn't be given out so much. My brother is demanding I apologize and his friend wants nothing to do with me anymore.",Asshole,1b90bdl
"AITA for insisting on when dishes have to be done? My GF and I have been living together for 5 months now. It’s been a bit of a learning curve but we’re adjusting. But like every couple, we have our episodes of bickering. To preface I am a very particular person. Especially with the correct use of utensils, placement of items in the household such as food and appliances and most relevant not leaving dishes overnight. With that being said my GF and I have a set of “terms and conditions” that we mutually abide by in the relationship. One of those being “ if one of us cooks, the other washes the dishes”. Now, I actually hate doing the dishes. Before this condition was set in stone it was an unspoken tradition. Though on occasion she would cook and I would ask her to clean and vise versa. To eliminate that frustration we had made this rule.  When she makes dinner I always wash the dishes before we go to bed, while she’d rather do them in the morning which I CAN’T STAND. Growing up I was never allowed to leave dishes over night and now it has stuck with me. It’s not only unsanitary but it can attract bugs. My GF just doesn’t understand that and we bicker about it every other day. Today I had enough.  I cooked like most days, and after I  relaxed and got comfortable. With it getting late I had insisted on my GF doing the dishes since she said she would after dinner. She gives me her signature line “can’t I just do it in the mornin?” *NOOOO GOD NOO WHY CANT SHE JUST  DO THEM*. Like she knows it makes my skin crawl, that’s why we have that condition. But after talking about it I realized I may have been dramatic and apologized for my reaction. BUT THEN SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY, “I’ll do half tonight and the other half tomorrow” LIKE THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE, THERES STILL DISHES IN THE SINK OVERNIGHT RIGHT!?! She believes that I am “doing too much” and that they will get cleaned eventually. I threw a fit and asked her “how did that make any sense?” To she followed with “Don’t worry about it there is no compromising with you, it has to always be your way”. So AITA for being so insistent on when the dishes are done and arguing with my gf about it?",Asshole,19870um
"AITA for stopping by my bestfriends house without notice? A little background since I feel it’s necessary for the situation. I (27F) have been lifelong friends with J (28F). 6 months ago J bought a home, which was a huge milestone goal for her and I was super proud! 

Before J had her own place she lived with her family as her parents wanted her to be able to save for a house without rent pressure. I am super close to her family by extension so it became normal over the years for me to just stop in without notice. I had kind of assumed that this would remain the same for her new home and it seemed fine for the first 5 months. 

What I think changed is that J’s partner P (25F) has moved in the last month when her lease was up on her apartment. When I would stop over randomly I could kind of tell she seemed a bit off by it but she never directly said anything at first. 

Yesterday I came by around after work and it was clear when I came in that I had interrupted date night. I apologized immediately but P was very upset. She tore into me about constantly dropping in without notice or invitation and that as a couple in their new home they deserved some alone time with me inserting myself. J backed her up on this and said that we are adults now and can’t spend the same amount of time with each other now that we have adult obligations. 

She’d like me to now wait until she invites me over or ask first before coming over. I think that her partner is turning her against me, we never had any issues before P moved in and I feel like she’s trying to separate us and make a boundary in Js home when she owns no part in the house and I said as much to J. I regret this now as J told me not to bother speaking to her until I can respect her partner and their home. 

I still think that P is trying to sabotage our friendship but no one in our friend group is taking my side. ",Asshole,1mir2jw
"AITA for refusing to give my mom a hug on mother's day? I (14f) hate hugging people or being touched in general. I've always been like this it's always been non-negotiable. I've also been very open about this to my entire family. Recently, my mother (who's usually quite respectful of the rule), declared I need to give her a hug on her birthday and mother's day. I absolutely understand those are important days for her, but I can't get past the chilling fear at the thought of being hugged. 
Today is mothers day and of course my mom tried to give me a hug. I ran away to my room though, and pleaded for her not to. She tried anyways and got me for a second before I broke free. She asked why I wouldn't and I explained once again I don't like being hugged. ""I know that, and that's why I don't do it often."" Was her response. And yes, she's right. She never does it and just asks for those two days. But I still makes me uncomfortable. She left looking really sad and now I feel like a complete asshole, in addition to my dad and sister calling me an asshole. So am I the asshole?

EDIT: I'd like to say I have already been recommended therapy for other issues. When that will happen I don't know. I would also like to clarify that being hugged or touched in general gives me really bad panic attacks, so I try to avoid it as much as possible. This started when I was around 10 and just got worse as years went on. When I do start therapy, I'll talk to my therapy about what to do about this

EDIT 2: I talked to my mom while in the car and suggested that instead of hugging she could give me high-fives or first-bumps. She said no though and said they weren't the same as hugging. My dad on the other hand accepted the idea and thankfully doesn't surprise hug me anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. I love my mom a lot, and I love spending time with her. I don't want her to hate me just because she, and no one else, can hug me.",No A-holes here,1kk5l20
"AITA- for telling my fiancé I don’t want his brother over.  I F (24) and my fiancé (27m) have been together for 4 years this month, he moved to live with me 3 years ago.

My fiancé doesn't get to see his family much, due to living an hour from them &amp; a lot of them tend to be not good to be around for his mental health.
But he hasn't been able to see his brother a lot over the last 6 years or so. He's only seen him a handful of times.

Anyways fast forward to today, I worked today, picked him up after work and we went home. He is having a couple drinks while on his game and out of nowhere he says ""I think my brothers going to be coming over this weekend and maybe have a couple drinks""

And I responded with ""oh... alright.""

He said ""what?""

I replied with ""oh nothing, I just wish you would asked me if I minded if he came over so I wouldn't feel like I wasn't being considered and if you would’ve just asked I would’ve said yes, but I don’t know how I feel about a 19 year old drinking in our apartment."" 

He goes on this rant about how he pays for half of the bills and how it's our apartment and if he wants to see his brother &amp; drink with him, he's allowed especially because he doesn't get to see him ever.

Then I pop off with “well then I don’t want him here at all!”

And all I could say back was ""I also pay half the bills and this is also my apartment and I would still like to feel considered in decisions on who is and isn't going to be at our apartment, I should get a choice and/or opinion on the matter""

"AITA for kicking my stepson out for coming home late? Me (40m) and my wife (39f) got married a month ago. I have a daughter (16f), she has a son (16m). Also my wife's ex died in a sad incident in 2015.

We met online, she was living in another city not far away. We started visiting each other and eventually got married. She moved into my house with her son.

Her son is an amateur photographer and graphic designer. He has worked for a couple of small magazines and micro influencer. I don't know how much, but he makes money from that. He's never taken any money from me. I've never seen him take anything from my wife either.

At first he was good with me and my daughter. We only argued twice and the second time I somehow ended up kicking him out of the house.

I can't tell you the whole first one because then it's over 3000 characters. It's just my daughter said something about the troubled guys he hangs out with. I warned him. He didn't argue, but he was very irritated. After that day, he continued to be nice to me and my daughter, but it was very fake.

Last week he had a photo shooting job and came home late. I told him that my house has an in and out rule and he shouldn't be so late. He calmly told me that he didn't come because he was working. I said him, ""I understand, but there are rules in this house.""

He said, ""Your house, your rules, but I don't think I can follow them when I'm working, sorry."" That made me mad and I said ""Maybe I need to think about some things."" He responded, ""Like what?"" Call me dumb for being provoked by a kid, but I got really pissed off and said, ""Like kick you out."" His mom tried to calm him down, it didn't work. He said, ""Think about it. I'm waiting.""

I don't want to tell the whole conversation, but in the final I told him, ""Then get out of my house."" He asked to my wife, ""Do you have anything to say about this?"" When she said, ""Let's sit down and talk in peace,"" he went to his room and locked the door.

Two hours later he packed all his things, called a taxi and left the house. When I asked him to stop, he said, ""Think twice before you speak."" My wife cried and begged, but he didn't listen to her either.

The next day in the evening he called my wife. He was back in his home city, staying with a friend for a while and then renting a house. He's a minor, I don't know how he's going to rent a house, but he's already not supposed to get on a plane or bus by himself. I really don't know how he got back. Cunt is really like one of those annoying kids in sitcoms. Wife had told me before that he was very stubborn, just like his father, but I didn't expect this much.

Things have been going downhill with my wife. I don't know what to do. AITA?

Edit: I have to say, I really didn't mean to kick him out. I just didn't think he was really going to leave. I also wanted to have a nice conversation, but he escalated the argument so quickly.",Asshole,16gavr7
"AITA for calling my MIL a bad house wife  I don't know where to turn to so I am turning to this. I called my MIL a bad house wife Infront of my husband and FIL. So a bit of back story. 

My hubby and I have been together for 4 years and married for 1and a half. His mom has never liked me and she can't give me a reason why even after I asked her. The smallest of things will set her off like when I was pregnant and the food she made triggered some nausea she almost went crazy. We have been living with them for about a year now and it has been a year of hell so far. 

In the past she has made house rules to suit her and when we played along with the rules she would get upset. My FIL works overseas and he comes home every few weeks. She does not clean the house before he comes home (and I mean their living area and their bedroom) when he is here she does not wash his clothes or hangs them. We had a rule in the house (her idea) that three times a week she makes food and them the rest of the week it is me and when you make food you have to clean the kitchen. 

The three days she makes food, she leaves the dishes in the sink until the morning of my day or she would ask my husband to clean the dishes before I start cooking. After a while she just stopped doing the dishes on her nights and my hubby and I had to clean the kitchen everyday. I talked to her about it because she would ask us to clean before her days begins and we agreed to keep to the house rule. 

FIL's last rotation came around and now he is home for good. They don't really talk to each other or even eat dinner together. On a grocery run I made with her, she told me that FIL is very unhappy with her because the house is always messy and she doesn't do his laundry but she told him that she will not be his cleaner and he can do it himself. 

The newest thing and the final straw for me was she started a diet recently and decided that she will only be making food for herself and I need to make food for the rest of the house. She will only be cleaning her own dishes. But she never does. She would leave her dishes in the sink until my hubby washes them or she would pick out her things from the full sink and was them. I decided that I would start doing the same as I am not the wife of this house. I started only cleaning my things and hubby's things and I could see it really bothered her. Then she started leaving all her dishes on the drying wrack for days until I ask her to pack them away. 

During the day I would be the one that offers to make my FIL a cup of coffee or something to eat as she just makes for herself. 

A few nights ago she was complaining about something my FIL did and I guess I just snapped. I said to her that she is a bad housewife because her job is to take care of her husband and she refuses to do that. 
Everything and everyone was silent for a few minutes and she just left the kitchen. So AITA?",Asshole,1g9kf9t
"AITA for stealing my friends lightbulb? okay i know this is going to sound bad but i honestly didn't think it was going to turn into this big of a deal and want other peoples opinions.  i (25/F) went over to some friends apartment recently for dinner with my gf (27/f). our friends are nice people, although a bit boring sometimes,  but they're the only other queer couple we know in the area we live in so we get along well enough. 

anyways, dinner was going fine and about half way through i had to excuse myself to the bathroom. as i was sitting on the toilet, i looked up and noticed that the light they had was really similar to a light in our house that we had been struggling to find a replacement for. im not sure why that specific light was so hard to replace but ig it was a special shape or something? im not entirely sure, my girlfriend does most fixing-up things around the house but i knew she had been complaining about not finding it in any home depot she went to. after further inspection, (standing precariously on the toilet and removing the light cover) i was almost 100% sure it was the same light. i had left my bag was in the front room, which was convenienty right next to the bathroom and was completely out of sight of the kitchen/dining area. so i unscrewed/detached the light and slipped it into my tote bag. thank you trader joes. we finished dinner relatively normally, (im pretty sure our friends are put off by me in general- which i get, im pretty bad with social norms) and everything was fine.

 once me and my gf got back home i revealed the light and she immediately started laughing asking me how i managed to get my hands on one. i explained my heist and she started laughing harder but shook her head and told me that what id done was A Bit Not Good (our favorite show is Sherlock we qoute it to eachother all the time) and that our friends would definitely notice. they actually noticed much quicker than i expected them too. they called my girlfriend that night asking if i had stolen a light from their bathroom, (which wow they just assumed it was me?? it was, so i guess i cant be upset over that)  she apologized and offered to drive over to return it that morining(we had been smoking a bit at this point) but they were PISSED. they started yelling at her telling her that this was ""the last straw"" and that they ""couldn't put up with [me] anymore"", basically telling her to dump me and that i was a ""major weirdo"" among other things. i know its awful but i had to leave the room so they wouldn't hear my hysterical laughter. my girlfriend is on my side, we've been together for 3yrs and shes seen me do much weirder things for much less vaild reasons, but now all of our friends are really fucking upset over the whole lightbulb thing. i do feel bad for not asking but i really didnt mean it maliciously, a unfunny prank at worst and a free lightbulb at best. what do i do? was this really so horrendous that i should lose friends over it?

UPDATE: 
ive received alot of responses to this post, which is nice i suppose. just to clear some things up; ive never taken anything from their house before, im not like a kleptomaniac i just saw the lightbulb and thought it would be funny and helpful. this is the type of shit my friends and i do and i expected them to ask for it back and i was very willing to give it back, i just didnt think that they would be so angry about it. the lightbulb has been returned, but everyones still in a mood over it. if they stole a lightbulb from my house i would've laughed it off, its a lightbulb not something super expensive.
  anyways, does anyone know where my gf can find this stupid light bulb? like any specialty sites or anything, bcuz she seems stressed about it this whole thing. her entire additude about this has changed, keeps saying that what i did was stupid and that i ""messed shit up"". idk what to do to get her to chill out about it but maybe finding the lightbulb will help

"AITA for giving away my girlfriends baby name? I (25 M) and my girlfriend (23 F) have been dating for 5 years. We both expect get married in the future and have kids in the somewhat distant future. I have always wanted to have kids, having always loved interacting with them and feeling a strong paternal nature. My girlfriend less so, but she still generally expects to have a child together in the future (a non-negotiable expectation I have expressed from the get-go). When discussing our future children, and specifically the aspect of their names, she has always deferred to me for choosing them, not expressing strong opinions about them. As such, for a few years now I have had a static list of names chosen that I would love for our children, and she has always agreed. 

However, 9 months ago my girlfriend grew a strong conviction for a name of a daughter. She became enamoured with this name when she recently learned it was her great grandmother's name. Frankly, for several small reasons, I do not like this name. I told this to her when she first mentioned it and she was very offended, although I was just being transparent with her. When she told me it was to honor her great grandmother I felt bad about it and said it was a fine name. That said, I was a bit upset that on a whim she was overruling the list of names we had long since agreed upon for a great grandmother she never met nor had any idea existed until this point in her life.

\~2 months later my girlfriends sister (25 F) became pregnant with her husband. 2 weeks ago they had a gender reveal party. At the party the had all sorts of fun gender related activities, namely one for people to write down names for a boy and a girl and but it in a box for them to read later in private. For the a girl, I put down the name my girlfriend wanted for a daughter. During the party its revealed that they are going to be having a girl. Now less than a week ago they share the two names they narrowed down their choices two with the family. Lo and behold, one of the two names they chose is the one I wrote for them. My girlfriend was made very upset by this. She immediately pegged that it was me who wrote down the name for them at the party and blamed me for giving away her baby name. While she was right, and I apologized for it, I argued that it was unfair for her to suddenly disregard the names that I had my heart set out on. However she did not care, and continued to ream me out for giving away her name. The past few days had been fairly tense, she is still very angry I gave away her baby name, and I have been uninterested in revolving tensions after she completely ignored my concerns in the situation.

"AITA for telling my girl friend that we don’t need to speak everyday? (M29)I’ve been friend with a girl(F32) I met at work for more than 5 years. We used to talk here and there, and meet up after work with other co-workers. Lately we started talking much more, which I suspect is because her boyfriend of 12+ years broke up with her. I like to talk about relationships, and male behavior so she kind of liked my “advice”. I knew something was funky (we used to go out a lot, and one day I just asked her if her bf had no problem with us going out so much), she then confessed they broke up like 6 months ago. Anyways, our friendship grew closer and she started talking to me every single day.

2 days ago, she stopped talking to me because she stopped by my house to give me something I asked her to buy (she was going to the store I had to go), I also told her she didn’t have to do the trip, I could simply go to her house and pick it up (5 mins trip). By the time she came to my house I was already drained from the day and she just started asking a bunch of questions which I told her I was tired and didn’t really have the energy to engage. So she throws a tantrum and says that she won’t be speaking or being good with me, which I thought she was bluffing but really stopped talking to me, until today.

So today, she messages me in the morning saying “we need to talk” and I simply replied “ok”. 

After I finish my daily routine and I’m back to my house, I message her to which she replied and asked :

“you only wrote to me because I told you we had to talk?” to which I replied “yes, you told me you wanted to talk”.

So she says, “yea, because you don’t text me unless I do”. To which I replied, “If we got no topic, there’s no need to talk”. 

Then she says, “I got nothing to tell you”. I replied, “I don’t think not speaking for a few days means I’m your enemy… I didn’t know that was a social rule”. To which she answered with a No. But I know she’s mad.

I’m very confused. AITA?

"AITA for letting my younger daughter pick my older daughter’s gift? My eldest daughter, Sarah’s, 20th birthday was last weekend. I went to Target to get a gift and had my 6 year old daughter, Hannah, with me. I told Hannah why we were going to the store and she got excited and wanted to pick out her big sister’s gift. I agreed and she ended up picking out a Bluey doll, because she said Sarah loves Bluey whenever they watch it together when Sarah babysits. I suggested maybe we get something else but Hannah was very insistent that this is what we get her big sister. Knowing that my ex (Sarah’s dad) and his wife would be getting Sarah other gifts, I decided to go with the doll and figured it’d be a cute/sweet gift that could remind Sarah of her sister.

Sarah stopped by the house on her birthday to have some cake and open her present. Hannah was so excited to give it to her. When Sarah opened it, I could see the disappointment on her face. But she quickly smiled, thanked Hannah and gave her a hug. After that, she left to have dinner with her friends. 

Sarah came to stay with us yesterday and will be with us through the holiday. She sheepishly asked me if that was really her only present. I said yes, it was very important to Hannah that she get to pick it out. Sarah says it’s kind of disappointing that I didn’t get her a “real gift”. I said this gift should feel special as it was something her little sister really wanted to get her.

"WIBTA to say no to sharing family Christmas I (F42) and my sister (F39) are the only two children of our mother. Our father died 7 years ago. My sister (let’s call her Mary) has two sons and a husband. I have one son and am divorced. Mary offered to host Christmas this year and that was fine until today when she said she plans to invite 3 (male) “orphans” from her workplace to join us. I don’t want this to happen because:
1.  We are only 5 adults (me, Mary, her husband, our mother and our elderly uncle) and 3 kids. Adding 3 strangers to an already very small family group will tip the balance and make it an awkward day. 
2.  My son (10) has autism and will really struggle to understand and cope with 3 random male strangers at our Christmas celebration. 
3. I always strive to have family traditions (which admittedly are hard to keep up in such a small family), but adding 3 (to us) random strangers will really affect the dynamics. 
I also think the 3 workmates probably wouldn’t want to come if they understood how intimate our family group is. They aren’t really orphans after all (they could do something the 3 of them and almost be the same sized group as us!). 
My sister has always wanted to invite “orphans” and when it was just one genuine, hard done by loner, I welcomed them too. But 3 workmates when we are only 5 adults in the first place is too much. AITAH to kick up a fuss and say no? ",No A-holes here,1pi2jg5
"AITA for asking my partner to get up and help me when he did a night shift the night before Yesterday I had to take our daughter to the children’s hospital due to a minor accident. He had worked late on the Friday and wasn’t in bed until 7:30am at the point I told him it was 11:30am he thought I was being ridiculous but, said he wasn’t mad and hugged me and went back to sleep. I was at the hospital all day basically as it was busy, and the environment was making me struggle. It’s a big children’s specialist hospital so there’s room you know. Anyway, I text my sister saying I couldn’t cope. I couldn’t get hold of my partner and in the past he would be annoyed at constant calls so I didn’t. She said she would call him and got nothing, so she said she would call my partners mum. She has her number from a while back and they get on really well. My partner’s mum tried to call him and said to my sister if she couldn’t get him she would drive to me. Which is what she ended up doing. She assumed he didn’t know about us being there. When she found out she went to town on him and had a go at him. She told me that later on when we were going home.

So after all of this I am feeling overstimulated and burnt out. I am the main carer for our child, I keep the house and the animals, and I also sort all the finances and make sure bills are paid. He has ADHD and when he was doing it they didn’t get paid so I took control of that. Because his mum was getting emails saying the rent wasn’t paid and she would have to pay etc. so I am doing a lot of both me and my daughter are sick too as well btw. 

So the thing here, he got up to use the toilet and I asked him if he was getting up and he said soon. And so I said okay, and then I saw he went back to sleep. This was around 12 midday. He came to bed probably like 5/6am today after work. Anyway I said to him I am burnt out blah blah everything I have explained above basically about yesterday and I’m trying to hold it together I’m stressed out I would appreciate it if he did get up. I left and started watching Christmas movies with my 2 year old. An hour later I went back and he’s mad at this point. I tried to hug him and he said it’s fucking weird. And I was like why is it weird I just been feeling stressed came to have a hug. Now if he said no please don’t hug me because blah blah okay I accept that. But, he was so mean about it that hurt my feelings. He got up, got dressed and ready to leave and I started explaining how he had upset me. And he was like my only options here are to ignore you or shout at you and I was like why. And he’s like because of how you’re speaking to me. And then he goes on to say that everything is a fucking test and it’s weird I watched the clock for an hour. Like I had no idea he had an alarm on for 1pm which is when he got up. And he just walked out slamming the door which scared our child. ",Asshole,1pgivus
